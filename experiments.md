#### Detailed Analysis

**Reward Optimization Success:**
- Clear upward trend from ~0.5 to ~1.8
- Shows the model is successfully learning to generate shorter responses

**KL Divergence Control - CRITICAL FAILURE:**
- Negative KL warning for 122/600 updates: UserWarning: KL divergence is starting to become negative: -30.55 - this might be a precursor for failed training. sometimes this happens because the generation kwargs are not correctly set. Please make sure that the generation kwargs are set correctly, or review your training hyperparameters.
- This is highly unusual behaviour - mathematically impossible, indicates numerical instability
- Extreme high KL values (20-300) far exceeding target_kl (0.1)
- Policy changing drastically from reference model
- Adaptive KL control mechanism completely failing

**Value Function Instability - MAJOR ISSUE:**
- Massive spikes reaching 3000+ around steps 300-400
- This is extremely unstable and indicates the value function is completely failing to predict returns
- Value function cannot adapt to rapidly changing reward distribution
- Causes unreliable advantage estimates, leading to poor policy updates

**Policy Loss Volatility:**
- Shows significant spikes (up to 1.2) around the same period
- More volatile than ideal, but not as severe as value loss
- Indicates noisy policy updates

**Entropy Collapse - EXPLORATION LOSS:**
- Rapid drop from ~11 to near 0 and stays there
- Model becomes too deterministic too quickly
- Reduces exploration capacity, potentially missing better solutions
- High clip fraction (0.2-0.4+) indicates many updates being clipped

**Policy Advantages - SURPRISINGLY STABLE:**
- Maintains near-zero values (~0 to -0.006) which is ideal
- Single spike around step 150 when value function lagged policy changes
- Recovery to near-zero shows healthy PPO dynamics
- Actually the most stable metric in the entire training

#### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Learning Rate Too High**: `1e-5` is too aggressive for the sharp reward landscape created by length-based rewards
2. **Inadequate KL Control**: Despite `init_kl_coef: 1`, the reward signal overwhelms KL penalties
3. **Sharp Reward Landscape**: Length-based rewards create discontinuous optimization surface

#### Conclusion:
While reward optimization is successful, the underlying training dynamics are quite unstable. The training suffers from:
- Failure of KL divergence control
- Severe value function instability  
- Loss of exploration through entropy collapse
- Numerical instability leading to impossible negative KL values

**Training Status**: Successful reward optimization but fundamentally unstable process that could lead to training collapse or unreproducible results.

### experiment 2
#### training description
Reduced learning rate from 1e-5 to 1e-6 while keeping all other hyperparameters identical to experiment 1.
Testing if more conservative learning rate can achieve stable training.

#### training results
![](graph/train_2_train.png)
![](graph/train_2_policy.png)

#### Detailed Analysis

**Training Stability - DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED:**
- **Value Loss**: Extremely stable throughout training, staying consistently low (~0.5-3.0 range)
- **Policy Loss**: Much more stable, oscillating gently around 0-0.015 range  
- **Total Loss**: Dominated by stable value loss, showing consistent training dynamics
- **No catastrophic spikes**: Complete elimination of the massive instabilities from experiment 1

**KL Divergence Control - MIXED RESULTS:**
- **Much more controlled**: KL values stay in manageable -3 to +1 range
- **Persistent negative KL**: Most updates show KL between 0 to -3, which is still concerning
- **No extreme spikes**: Eliminated the dangerous 20-300 KL spikes from experiment 1
- **Better but not perfect**: Still indicates some numerical/computational issues

**Value Function Performance - EXCELLENT:**
- **Prediction Error**: Stable and low throughout training (1-4 range vs 14+ in experiment 1)
- **Explained Variance**: Steady improvement from -6 to 0, indicating value function learning well
- **Clip Fraction**: Very low and stable, showing appropriate update magnitudes

**Policy Behavior - STABLE BUT LIMITED LEARNING:**
- **Entropy**: More gradual decline from ~1.8 to ~2.5, maintaining some exploration
- **Clip Fraction**: Very low (~0.01), indicating small, conservative policy updates
- **Approx KL**: Consistently low (~0.0005), showing minimal policy changes

**Reward Learning - CONCERNING LACK OF PROGRESS:**
- **Minimal improvement**: Reward stays mostly flat around 0.9-1.2 range
- **No clear learning trend**: Unlike experiment 1's clear upward trajectory
- **Model barely adapting**: Learning rate may now be too conservative

#### Stability vs Learning Trade-off Analysis

**What We Gained:**
✅ **Eliminated catastrophic instabilities** (value loss spikes, extreme KL divergence)  
✅ **Stable value function** learning and prediction  
✅ **Controlled policy updates** without dangerous divergence  
✅ **Reproducible training** without numerical issues  
✅ **Better entropy management** maintaining exploration longer  

**What We Lost:**
❌ **Minimal reward optimization** - model not learning the task effectively  
❌ **Slow adaptation** to reward signals  
❌ **Potential under-exploration** of policy space  
❌ **Learning efficiency** significantly reduced  

#### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Over-Conservative Learning Rate**: `1e-6` may be too small for meaningful policy updates
2. **Reward Signal Insufficient**: Weak gradients not strong enough to drive learning
3. **KL Penalty Dominance**: KL control now overpowering reward optimization  
4. **Exploration-Exploitation Balance**: Too much emphasis on stability, insufficient exploration

#### Negative KL Persistence

The persistent negative KL (-3 to 0) suggests:
- **Computational precision issues**: Even with stable training, some numerical problems remain
- **Reference model drift**: Possible issues with reference model consistency  
- **Log probability calculations**: Still some instability in probability computations
- **Not immediately dangerous**: Unlike experiment 1, these are manageable magnitudes

#### Conclusion:
Experiment 2 successfully solved the stability issues but at the cost of learning effectiveness. The 10x learning rate reduction created a **stable but under-performing training regime**. 

**Key Finding**: Need to find the optimal learning rate between 1e-6 (too conservative) and 1e-5 (too aggressive).

**Training Status**: Stable training achieved but insufficient task learning - requires learning rate tuning.

### experiment 3
#### training description
Testing whether reward magnitude affects training stability. All hyperparameters identical to experiment 1 (learning rate back to 1e-5), but reward scaled down by factor of 0.1.
- Original reward: `reward = 2 - length/16`
- Scaled reward: `reward = (2 - length/16) * 0.1`

Hypothesis: Smaller reward values might reduce gradient magnitudes and improve stability.

#### training results
![](graph/train_3_train.png)
![](graph/train_3_policy.png)

#### Detailed Analysis

**Training Stability - NO IMPROVEMENT:**
- **Value Loss**: Identical pattern to experiment 1 - massive spikes reaching 2000+ around steps 200-300
- **Policy Loss**: Same volatility pattern with spikes up to 0.8+ during unstable periods
- **Total Loss**: Dominated by value loss instabilities, showing identical dynamics to experiment 1

**KL Divergence Control - SAME FAILURE PATTERN:**
- **Extreme KL spikes**: Values reaching 250+ around steps 200-300, identical to experiment 1
- **Negative KL periods**: Same problematic negative KL values during unstable phases
- **Pattern identical**: KL control failing in exactly the same way as experiment 1

**Value Function Performance - SAME INSTABILITIES:**
- **Prediction Error**: Massive spikes reaching 3000+ matching experiment 1 pattern
- **Explained Variance**: Same dramatic drops during instability periods
- **Clip Fraction**: High values during unstable periods, same as experiment 1

**Policy Behavior - IDENTICAL PROBLEMS:**
- **Entropy**: Same rapid collapse pattern from ~4 to near 0
- **Clip Fraction**: High values (~0.3-0.5) during unstable training phases
- **Approx KL**: Same extreme spikes up to 12+ during instability

**Reward Learning - SCALED BUT SAME PATTERN:**
- **Clear learning trend**: Strong upward trajectory from ~0.05 to ~0.18 (scaled version of 0.5→1.8)
- **Learning effectiveness**: Model still successfully learns to generate shorter responses
- **Scaling confirmation**: Reward values exactly 0.1x of experiment 1, confirming correct implementation

#### Critical Finding: Reward Magnitude Irrelevant to Stability

**Key Insight**: Scaling reward by 0.1 had **zero effect** on training stability. All instability patterns from experiment 1 are perfectly reproduced:

✅ **Hypothesis Disproven**: Small reward values do NOT improve training stability  
✅ **Learning Rate is Key**: Confirms that learning rate (1e-5) is the critical factor  
✅ **Reward Scaling Works**: Model learns proportionally scaled rewards correctly  
✅ **Gradient Magnitude Theory Invalid**: Smaller rewards don't reduce problematic gradient magnitudes  

#### Root Cause Analysis Confirmation

This experiment definitively rules out **reward magnitude** as a stability factor:

1. **Learning Rate Dominates**: 1e-5 creates instability regardless of reward scale
2. **Gradient Flow Issues**: Instability stems from optimization dynamics, not reward values
3. **Policy Update Size**: Learning rate controls update magnitudes, not reward scale
4. **Value Function Adaptation**: Struggles with optimization landscape shape, not reward range

#### Conclusion:
Experiment 3 provides crucial negative evidence: **reward magnitude does not affect training stability**. All instabilities from experiment 1 are perfectly reproduced despite 10x smaller rewards.

**Definitive Finding**: Learning rate (not reward scale) controls training stability in this PPO setup.

**Training Status**: Confirms that learning rate optimization is the critical path forward - reward engineering is not the solution.

### experiment 4
#### training description
Testing interaction between learning rate and KL penalty. Based on experiment 2's stability but poor learning, reduced KL penalty to encourage more policy updates.
- Learning rate: 1e-6 (same as experiment 2 - stable)
- KL penalty: init_kl_coef reduced from 1.0 to 0.5
- All other hyperparameters identical to experiment 2

Hypothesis: Lower KL penalty will allow more policy exploration while maintaining stability from low learning rate.

#### training results
![](graph/train_4_train.png)
![](graph/train_4_policy.png)

#### Detailed Analysis

**Training Stability - MAINTAINED:**
- **Value Loss**: Remains stable like experiment 2, no catastrophic spikes
- **Policy Loss**: Similarly controlled, maintaining the stability benefits of lr=1e-6
- **Total Loss**: Stable training dynamics preserved

**Reward Learning - STILL MINIMAL:**
- **Marginal improvement**: Less than 0.1 improvement, similar to experiment 2
- **Insufficient learning**: KL penalty reduction did not meaningfully improve task learning
- **Learning rate bottleneck**: 1e-6 appears to be the limiting factor, not KL penalty

**KL Divergence - INCREASED NEGATIVE VALUES:**
- **Expanded range**: KL now between 0 to -15 (vs 0 to -3 in experiment 2)
- **More negative**: Lower KL penalty allows larger policy deviations
- **Still problematic**: Negative KL values indicate persistent numerical issues

**Entropy Behavior - UNEXPECTED INCREASE:**
- **Higher entropy**: Increased to ~5 (vs stable 2-3 in experiment 2)
- **More exploration**: Policy maintaining more randomness/exploration
- **Positive sign**: Indicates policy is less deterministic

#### Key Insights from KL and Entropy Changes

**What the KL Change (0~-3 → 0~-15) Means:**
1. **Policy Diverging More**: Lower KL penalty allows policy to deviate further from reference
2. **Computational Issues Amplified**: More negative KL suggests numerical instability growing
3. **Expected Behavior**: Reduced penalty should increase KL magnitude
4. **Still Controlled**: Unlike experiment 1's extreme spikes, this is gradual increase

**What the Entropy Increase (2-3 → 5) Means:**
1. **More Exploration**: Policy maintaining higher randomness in outputs
2. **Less Deterministic**: Model not collapsing to single response pattern
3. **Positive Development**: Better exploration could lead to better solutions
4. **KL Penalty Effect**: Lower penalty allows more diverse policy outputs

#### Root Cause Analysis

**KL Penalty Reduction Effects:**
✅ **Successfully increased exploration** (higher entropy)  
✅ **Maintained training stability** (no value loss spikes)  
✅ **Allowed more policy deviation** (expanded KL range)  
❌ **Did not improve learning** (reward still flat)  

#### Critical Finding: KL Penalty vs Learning Rate Hierarchy

**Key Insight**: Reducing KL penalty affects **exploration behavior** but not **learning speed**:

🎯 **Learning Rate**: Controls magnitude of policy updates (how much change)  
🎯 **KL Penalty**: Controls direction/freedom of policy updates (what kind of change)  
🎯 **Hierarchy**: Learning rate dominates - without sufficient magnitude, direction doesn't matter  

#### Interpretation of Results

**Why Entropy Increased:**
- **Exploration space expanded**: Lower KL penalty allows more diverse outputs
- **Less premature convergence**: Policy not forced into narrow solutions
- **Positive for future**: Higher entropy provides foundation for learning if gradients increase

**Why KL Became More Negative:**
- **Computational precision**: Larger policy deviations exacerbate numerical issues
- **Expected direction**: Lower penalty should increase KL magnitude
- **Still manageable**: Unlike experiment 1, this is gradual increase not explosive

#### Conclusion:
Experiment 4 confirms that **learning rate is the primary bottleneck**, not KL penalty. Reducing KL penalty successfully increased exploration (higher entropy) and policy freedom (larger KL range) while maintaining stability, but failed to improve learning because the learning rate (1e-6) remains too conservative.

**Key Finding**: KL penalty and learning rate have **different roles** - learning rate controls learning speed, KL penalty controls exploration behavior.

**Training Status**: Stable training maintained, exploration improved, but learning rate still needs optimization for meaningful task progress.

### experiment 5
#### training description
Testing whether increasing PPO epochs can improve learning speed while maintaining stability from experiment 4.
- Learning rate: 1e-6 (stable from experiments 2 & 4)
- KL penalty: init_kl_coef = 0.5
- PPO epochs: increased from 1 to 2
- All other hyperparameters identical to experiment 4

Hypothesis: More PPO epochs will increase learning speed by doing more updates per batch, leading to faster reward improvement and controlled KL growth.

#### training results
![](graph/train_5_train.png)
![](graph/train_5_policy.png)

#### Detailed Analysis

**Reward Learning - STILL MINIMAL:**
- **No obvious improvement**: Reward learning remains flat, similar to experiments 2 & 4
- **PPO epochs ineffective**: Doubling epochs did not overcome the learning rate bottleneck
- **Fundamental limit**: 1e-6 learning rate still too conservative regardless of epoch count

**KL Divergence - IMPROVED STABILITY:**
- **Better controlled range**: KL stays between +1 to -3 (vs 0 to -15 in experiment 4)
- **More stable than experiment 2**: Even better KL control than the baseline stable experiment
- **Unexpected improvement**: PPO epochs helped stabilize KL behavior

**Policy Loss - SYSTEMATIC SHIFT:**
- **Negative bias**: Policy loss now consistently around -0.025 (vs ~0 in experiment 4)
- **More consistent**: Less volatility compared to experiment 4
- **Systematic pattern**: Indicates different optimization dynamics

**Value Function - MAINTAINED STABILITY:**
- **Prediction error stable**: Continues excellent stability from previous experiments
- **Explained variance**: Steady improvement pattern maintained
- **No degradation**: Additional epochs didn't destabilize value function

**Entropy - FLATTENED BEHAVIOR:**
- **Less dynamic**: Entropy becomes more flat around 3.0-3.5 range
- **Reduced exploration variance**: Less fluctuation compared to experiment 4's ~5.0 levels
- **Different exploration pattern**: More consistent but potentially less diverse

**Policy Behavior - INCREASED ACTIVITY:**
- **Higher clip fraction**: Increased clipping indicates more aggressive policy updates
- **Higher approx_kl**: More approximate KL divergence, showing larger policy changes
- **More update activity**: PPO epochs enabling more policy modification

#### Critical Analysis: Why These Changes Occurred

**KL Stabilization (1 to -3 vs 0 to -15):**
1. **Multiple updates per batch**: 2 PPO epochs allow policy to "settle" within each batch
2. **Better optimization**: Multiple passes help find more stable policy updates
3. **Gradient averaging**: Multiple epochs smooth out erratic gradient directions
4. **Unexpected benefit**: PPO epochs helped control, not just speed up learning

**Policy Loss Shift (0 → -0.025):**
1. **Optimization dynamics change**: Multiple epochs alter the loss landscape traversal
2. **Different equilibrium**: Policy finding different stable point with more updates
3. **Systematic bias**: Consistent negative values suggest underlying optimization pattern
4. **Not necessarily problematic**: Stable negative loss can be normal in PPO

**Entropy Flattening (variable ~5 → flat ~3.5):**
1. **Reduced exploration variance**: More epochs leading to more consistent policy
2. **Optimization settling**: Multiple passes reducing policy uncertainty
3. **Trade-off**: Less exploration diversity but more stable behavior
4. **Mixed result**: Stability gained but exploration potentially reduced

**Increased Clip Fraction & Approx KL:**
1. **More aggressive updates**: Multiple epochs enabling larger policy changes per batch
2. **Learning rate amplification**: Even small lr becomes more effective with multiple epochs
3. **Expected behavior**: More epochs should increase update magnitudes
4. **Still controlled**: Unlike experiment 1, these increases are manageable

#### PPO Epochs Effect Analysis

**What PPO Epochs Actually Did:**
✅ **Improved KL stability** (unexpected positive effect)  
✅ **Maintained overall training stability** (no catastrophic failures)  
✅ **Increased policy update activity** (higher clip fraction, approx KL)  
✅ **Smoothed optimization dynamics** (more consistent losses)  
❌ **Did not overcome learning rate bottleneck** (reward still flat)  
🟡 **Reduced exploration variance** (flatter entropy - mixed result)  

#### Key Insights

**PPO Epochs as Stabilization Tool:**
- **Unexpected finding**: PPO epochs improved stability more than learning speed
- **Optimization smoothing**: Multiple passes help find better local optima
- **KL control benefit**: Better than just reducing learning rate alone
- **New hyperparameter role**: PPO epochs as stability enhancer, not just speed booster

**Learning Rate Still Bottleneck:**
- **Consistent pattern**: 5 experiments confirm learning rate is primary constraint
- **Epochs insufficient**: Can't overcome fundamentally small gradient magnitudes
- **Next step clear**: Must increase learning rate to see meaningful reward learning

#### Conclusion:
Experiment 5 reveals that **PPO epochs act as a stabilization tool** rather than just a learning accelerator. While reward learning remained minimal due to the learning rate bottleneck, the training became more stable with better KL control and smoother optimization dynamics.

**Unexpected Discovery**: PPO epochs = 2 provides better stability than epochs = 1, making it a valuable hyperparameter for controlled training.

**Training Status**: Most stable configuration yet achieved, but learning rate increase still necessary for meaningful task progress.

### experiment 6
#### training description
Testing Boolean query format reward function while maintaining optimal stable configuration from experiment 5.
- Learning rate: 1e-6 (stable)
- KL penalty: init_kl_coef = 0.5 (exploration)
- PPO epochs: 2 (enhanced stability)
- **NEW**: Boolean format-based reward function instead of length-based
- All other hyperparameters identical to experiment 5

Hypothesis: Different reward function will change reward magnitude but maintain training stability from experiment 5.

#### reward function
Changed from length-based to Boolean query format reward:
```python
def compute_reward(query):
    reward = 0.0
    query_upper = query.upper()
    q = query.split()
    length = len(q)
    
    # Boolean operators reward
    has_and = ' AND ' in query_upper
    has_or = ' OR ' in query_upper
    has_boolean = has_and or has_or
    if has_boolean:
        reward += 0.3
    
    # Phrase pattern reward: (text) AND/OR (text)
    phrase_pattern = r'\([^)]+\)\s+(AND|OR)\s+\([^)]+\)'
    has_phrase_pattern = bool(re.search(phrase_pattern, query_upper))
    if has_phrase_pattern:
        reward += 0.5
    
    # Length reward (sweet spot)
    if 5 < length < 30:
        reward += 0.2
    
    return reward  # Range: 0.0 to 1.0
```

#### training results
![](graph/train_6_train.png)
![](graph/train_6_policy.png)

#### Detailed Analysis

**Training Stability - MAINTAINED:**
- **Value Loss**: Identical stability pattern to experiment 5
- **Policy Loss**: Same controlled behavior around -0.025
- **Total Loss**: Stable training dynamics preserved
- **KL Control**: Maintained excellent range (+1 to -3)

**Reward Learning - CHANGED AS EXPECTED:**
- **Different reward scale**: Now in 0.0-1.0 range (vs previous length-based scales)
- **Reward pattern**: Reflects Boolean query format optimization instead of length
- **Model adaptation**: Learning to generate Boolean operators and structured queries
- **Magnitude change only**: Training dynamics unchanged

**Policy Behavior - IDENTICAL STABILITY:**
- **Entropy**: Same flat pattern around 3.0-3.5 range
- **Clip Fraction**: Similar levels to experiment 5
- **Approx KL**: Same controlled behavior
- **Value Function**: Identical stability metrics

**Critical Finding: Reward Function Independence from Training Stability**

This experiment provides definitive evidence that **reward function design does not affect training stability** when hyperparameters are properly tuned.

#### Key Insights

**Reward Function vs Training Stability Separation:**
- **Training stability**: Determined by learning rate, PPO epochs, KL penalty
- **Reward function**: Only affects what the model learns, not how stably it learns
- **Orthogonal effects**: Can change reward goals without affecting training dynamics

**Successful Hyperparameter Configuration:**
- **Learning rate 1e-6**: Provides stable foundation for any reward function
- **PPO epochs 2**: Enhances stability regardless of reward design
- **KL penalty 0.5**: Maintains exploration for any learning objective
- **Configuration robustness**: Stable across different reward landscapes

#### Conclusion:
Experiment 6 confirms that **properly tuned hyperparameters create robust training stability independent of reward function design**. The stable configuration from experiment 5 successfully handles different reward landscapes while maintaining excellent training dynamics.

**Key Finding**: Training stability and reward function design are **orthogonal concerns** - stable hyperparameters enable reliable learning regardless of the reward objective.

**Training Status**: Robust stable configuration validated across different reward functions. Ready for systematic learning rate exploration to increase learning speed while maintaining stability.

### experiment 7
#### training description
Testing whether extended training duration can overcome learning bottleneck by increasing training steps from 600 to 1000.
- Training steps increased from 600 to 1000 (+67% more training)
- All other hyperparameters identical to experiment 6

Hypothesis: More training steps might allow the model to eventually learn despite the conservative learning rate.

#### training results
![](graph/train_7_train.png)
![](graph/train_7_policy.png)

#### Detailed Analysis

**Training Stability - MAINTAINED:**
- **Identical stability patterns**: All stability metrics unchanged from experiment 6
- **Extended stability**: Stable behavior sustained over longer training duration
- **No degradation**: No instabilities emerged with extended training

**Reward Learning - NO IMPROVEMENT:**
- **Flat reward curve**: Average reward remained essentially unchanged
- **No learning progression**: 67% more training steps produced no additional learning
- **Learning plateau**: Model stuck at same performance level regardless of training duration
- **Fundamental bottleneck confirmed**: Training time is not the limiting factor

**Policy Behavior - UNCHANGED:**
- **Identical dynamics**: All policy metrics behaved identically to experiment 6
- **No exploration benefits**: Extended training didn't improve exploration or discovery
- **Stable convergence**: Model appears to have reached equilibrium very early

**Critical Finding: Training Duration Independence**

This experiment provides definitive evidence that **training duration does not overcome learning rate bottlenecks**.

#### Key Insights

**Learning Rate as Fundamental Bottleneck:**
- **Gradient magnitude**: 1e-6 creates tiny parameter updates regardless of training duration
- **Time independence**: Small gradients × more time ≠ meaningful learning
- **Plateau effect**: Model reaches limited performance ceiling very early
- **Diminishing returns**: Extended training provides no additional benefit

**Training Efficiency Implications:**
- **Optimal training length**: 600 steps sufficient to reach performance ceiling with lr=1e-6
- **Resource waste**: Additional 400 steps provided zero learning benefit
- **Early convergence**: Model performance stabilizes much earlier than expected
- **Cost-benefit**: Longer training increases computational cost without benefit

**Systematic Evidence Building:**
- **Experiment 2-6**: Confirmed learning rate is primary factor
- **Experiment 7**: Proves training duration cannot compensate for learning rate limitations
- **Convergent evidence**: Multiple approaches confirm same bottleneck

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Why Extended Training Failed:**
1. **Learning rate dominance**: 1e-6 creates fundamentally insufficient gradient magnitudes
2. **Parameter update scale**: Tiny changes accumulate too slowly for meaningful adaptation
3. **Optimization landscape**: Conservative updates can't navigate reward landscape effectively
4. **Value function limitation**: Small updates prevent value function from adapting to new policies

**Mathematical Perspective:**
- **Parameter change**: Δθ = lr × gradient
- **With lr=1e-6**: Even large gradients produce minimal parameter changes
- **Cumulative effect**: 1000 × tiny_change ≈ 600 × tiny_change ≈ minimal_total_change
- **Threshold effect**: Need minimum gradient magnitude for meaningful learning

#### Conclusion:
Experiment 7 definitively proves that **learning rate, not training duration, is the fundamental bottleneck**. Extended training cannot compensate for insufficient gradient magnitudes created by overly conservative learning rates.

**Key Finding**: Training duration and learning rate are **not substitutable** - small learning rates cannot be overcome by longer training when the gradient magnitudes are fundamentally too small for meaningful parameter updates.

**Training Status**: Learning rate confirmed as the critical bottleneck. Extended training provides no benefit with current configuration. Immediate priority: learning rate optimization.
