Its putative target, circulating VEGF-A, emerged as the main candidate and we sought to identify the relationship between VEGF-A levels and outcomes through systematic review. We searched electronic databases and meeting proceedings for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy for breast cancer. RCTs were included if outcomes were presented separately according to VEGF-A plasma levels. Random-effects model were applied to calculate the pooled hazard ratios for progression-free survival, event-free survival (EFS), comprising disease recurrence, progression or any-cause death, and overall survival (OS), with respective confidence intervals (95 % CI). High and low VEGF-A levels subgroups followed each trial definition, and results were compared using the interaction test. Heterogeneity was calculated using χ (2) test (I (2)). Three trials enrolled a total of 3748 patients. 1713 patients had baseline VEGF-A levels in plasma available for assessment and were included. One trial added bevacizumab in the adjuvant setting (N = 2591) and two on first-line metastatic disease with taxane-based therapy (N = 1160) There was no interaction between VEGF-A levels and study setting (adjuvant vs. first line therapy).

No increase or small improvements in bone mineral density (BMD) after WBV interventions were observed in reviews regarding postmenopausal women. One intervention study regarding young adults was included and reported no bone-related benefits from WBV. Most reviews including children and adolescents with compromised bone mass showed an improvement of BMD at lower limbs, lumbar spine, and whole body.

Intervention strength was positively correlated with reporting of positive anthropometric outcomes for physical activity, diet, and combined interventions, and parent engagement components increased the strength of these relationships. Study quality was modestly related to percent successful healthy eating outcomes. Relationships between intervention strength and behavioral outcomes demonstrated negative relationships for all behavioral outcomes. Specific components of intervention strength (number of intervention strategies, potential impact of strategies, frequency of use, and duration of intervention) were correlated with some of the anthropometric and parent engagement outcomes.

The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to ascertain whether the risk for mental health problems is greater for ELBW survivors than their normal birth weight (NBW) peers in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Forty-one studies assessing 2,712 ELBW children, adolescents, and adults and 11,127 NBW controls were reviewed. Group differences in mental health outcomes were assessed using random effects meta-analyses. The impacts of birthplace, birth era, and neurosensory impairment on mental health outcomes were assessed in subgroup analyses. Children born at ELBW were reported by parents and teachers to be at significantly greater risk than NBW controls for inattention and hyperactivity, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. ELBW children were also at greater risk for conduct and oppositional disorders, autistic symptoms, and social difficulties. Risks for parent-reported inattention and hyperactivity, internalizing, and social problems were greater in adolescents born at ELBW. In contrast, ELBW teens self-reported lower inattention, hyperactivity, and oppositional behavior levels than their NBW peers. Depression, anxiety, and social difficulties were elevated in ELBW survivors in adulthood. Group differences were robust to region of birth, era of birth, and the presence of neurosensory impairments. The complex needs faced by children born at ELBW continue throughout development, with long-term consequences for psychological and social well-being.

Our data sources relied on handsearches of four previous good-quality systematic reviews, which all conducted electronic searches of primarily MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. An independent, supplemental electronic search of MEDLINE was undertaken as well (last searched June 2007). Only English-language publications of randomized controlled trials of therapeutic hypothermia in adults with TBI were selected for analysis. Two reviewers independently abstracted data on trial design, patient population, hypothermia and cointervention protocols, patient outcomes, and aspects of methodological quality. Pooled relative risks (RR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each outcome using random-effects models. In the current study, only 13 trials met eligibility criteria, with a total of 1339 randomized patients. Sensitivity analyses revealed that outcomes were influenced by variations in methodological quality. Consequently, main analyses were conducted based on eight trials that demonstrated the lowest potential for bias (n = 781). Reductions in risk of mortality were greatest (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.33, 0.79) and favorable neurologic outcomes much more common (RR 1.91; 95% CI 1.28, 2.85) when hypothermia was maintained for more than 48 h.

A working group was convened comprised of practising gynaecologists and experts in evidence-based medicine from Europe, as well as an endometriosis self-help group representative. After reviewing existing evidence-based guidelines and systematic reviews, the expert panel met on three occasions for a day during which the guideline was developed and refined. Recommendations based solely on the clinical experience of the panel were avoided as much as possible. The entire ESHRE Special Interest Group for Endometriosis and Endometrium was given the opportunity to comment on the draft guideline, after which it was available for comment on the ESHRE website for 3 months. The working group then ratified the guideline by unanimous or near-unanimous voting; finally, it was approved by the ESHRE Executive Committee. The guideline will be updated regularly, and will be made available at http://www.endometriosis.org/guidelines.html with hyperlinks to the supporting evidence, and the relevant references and abstracts. For women presenting with symptoms suggestive of endometriosis, a definitive diagnosis of most forms of endometriosis requires visual inspection of the pelvis at laparoscopy as the 'gold standard' investigation. However, pain symptoms suggestive of the disease can be treated without a definitive diagnosis using a therapeutic trial of a hormonal drug to reduce menstrual flow. In women with laparoscopically confirmed disease, suppression of ovarian function for 6 months reduces endometriosis-associated pain; all hormonal drugs studied are equally effective although their side-effects and cost profiles differ. Ablation of endometriotic lesions reduces endometriosis-associated pain and the smallest effect is seen in patients with minimal disease; there is no evidence that also performing laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation (LUNA) is necessary. In minimal-mild endometriosis, suppression of ovarian function to improve fertility is not effective, but ablation of endometriotic lesions plus adhesiolysis is effective compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There is insufficient evidence available to determine whether surgical excision of moderate-severe endometriosis enhances pregnancy rates. IVF is appropriate treatment especially if there are coexisting causes of infertility and/or other treatments have failed, but IVF pregnancy rates are lower in women with endometriosis than in those with tubal infertility. The management of severe/deeply infiltrating endometriosis is complex and referral to a centre with the necessary expertise is strongly recommended.

The recommendations presented in this document provide guidance on patient selection and risk stratification; informed consent and opioid management plans; initiation and titration of chronic opioid therapy; use of methadone; monitoring of patients on chronic opioid therapy; dose escalations, high-dose opioid therapy, opioid rotation, and indications for discontinuation of therapy; prevention and management of opioid-related adverse effects; driving and work safety; identifying a medical home and when to obtain consultation; management of breakthrough pain; chronic opioid therapy in pregnancy; and opioid-related policies."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with chronic noncancer pain", "I": "Chronic opioid therapy", "C": "Alternative therapies or non-opioid treatments", "O": "Effectiveness, adverse effects, abuse potential, patient outcomes"}, "publication_pmids": ["1513222", "9779694", "10760625", "17157780", "17449988", "17207304", "17237667", "14996236", "17559481", "11929502", "12855350", "16336480", "17617282", "15773875", "12842375", "16482756", "14612481", "12565187", "16414554", "16877186", "17060538", "15772912", "15857742", "18187075"], "pub_date": "2009/02/01"}

Eleven studies were selected and retrieved from the databases. The results of meta-analysis revealed that the effects of Tai Chi Chuan were observed for physical components in the body functions and structures domain. The effects favoring Tai Chi Chuan were observed in the physical component in the activities and participation domain. Insufficient data was included in the meta-analysis of the mental component. Conclusions. The review revealed that Tai Chi Chuan had beneficial outcomes for patients with knee osteoarthritis.

In therapy naïve women, we found no evidence of a difference in live birth rate when comparing metformin with clomifene citrate (CC) [relative risks (RR) 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-1.1] or comparing metformin plus CC with CC (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.82-1.3).

Inappropriate referral to oncology services can lead to unnecessary surgery or overly radical interventions compromising fertility in young women, whilst the consequences of failing to recognize cancer significantly impact on prognosis. By reflecting on recent developments of new diagnostic tests for preoperative identification of malignant disease in women with adnexal masses, we aimed to update a previous systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS An extended search was performed in MEDLINE (PubMed) and EMBASE (OvidSp) from March 2008 to October 2013. Eligible studies provided information on diagnostic test performance of models, designed to predict ovarian cancer in a preoperative setting, that contained at least two variables. Study selection and extraction of study characteristics, types of bias, and test performance was performed independently by two reviewers. Quality was assessed using a modified version of the QUADAS assessment tool. A bivariate hierarchical random effects model was used to produce summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals or plot summary ROC curves for all models considered. RESULTS Our extended search identified a total of 1542 new primary articles. In total, 195 studies were eligible for qualitative data synthesis, and 96 validation studies reporting on 19 different prediction models met the predefined criteria for quantitative data synthesis. These models were tested on 26 438 adnexal masses, including 7199 (27%) malignant and 19 239 (73%) benign masses. The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) was the most frequently validated model. The logistic regression model LR2 with a risk cut-off of 10% and Simple Rules (SR), both developed by the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) study, performed better than all other included models with a pooled sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 0.92 [95% CI 0.88-0.95] and 0.83 [95% CI 0.77-0.88] for LR2 and 0.93 [95% CI 0.89-0.95] and 0.81 [95% CI 0.76-0.85] for SR. A meta-analysis of centre-specific results stratified for menopausal status of two multicentre cohorts comparing LR2, SR and RMI-1 (using a cut-off of 200) showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity in premenopausal women for LR2 of 0.85 [95% CI 0.75-0.91] and 0.91 [95% CI 0.83-0.96] compared with 0.93 [95% CI 0.84-0.97] and 0.83 [95% CI 0.73-0.90] for SR and 0.44 [95% CI 0.28-0.62] and 0.95 [95% CI 0.90-0.97] for RMI-1. In post-menopausal women, sensitivity and specificity of LR2, SR and RMI-1 were 0.94 [95% CI 0.89-0.97] and 0.70 [95% CI 0.62-0.77], 0.93 [95% CI 0.88-0.96] and 0.76 [95% CI 0.69-0.82], and 0.79 [95% CI 0.72-0.85] and 0.90 [95% CI 0.84-0.94], respectively.

This review identifies factors associated with adherence and what is known about the effectiveness of adherence-enhancement programmes. A comprehensive systematic review of English language publications from January 2002 to October 2011 was conducted using the following databases: PUBMED/MEDLINE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane database. Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria for adherence-enhancement evaluations. Eleven of the studies evaluated demonstrated significantly positive effects on adherence; the remaining 10 reported mixed or no effects. Similar to previous literature reviews, factors shown to be associated with adherence were multifactorial and in this analysis were grouped as patient, condition and comorbidities, therapy or treatment, patient-provider relationship and healthcare system level. Adherence improved most notably in studies that included sustainable system and patient-targeted changes. Evaluating adherence-enhancement interventions is key to promoting successful approaches; however, a number of gaps exist between intervention and implementation: (1) the cost in resources and time to implement and sustain these programmes is unknown, (2) specific details about which subgroups of patients are best helped with such programmes is not clear, and (3) what specific processes or content are critical to programme success is still to be identified.

Increasing attention is being paid to the role of people with disabilities in the workplace. Although most research focuses on employers' concerns, many companies are now beginning to share their successes. However, there is no synthesis of the peer-reviewed literature on the benefits of hiring people with disabilities. Methods Our team conducted a systematic review, completing comprehensive searches of seven databases from 1997 to May 2017. We selected articles for inclusion that were peer-reviewed publications, had a sample involving people with disabilities, conducted an empirical study with at least one outcome focusing on the benefits of hiring people with disabilities, and focused on competitive employment. Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and rated the study quality. Results Of the 6176 studies identified in our search, 39 articles met our inclusion criteria. Findings show that benefits of hiring people with disabilities included improvements in profitability (e.g., profits and cost-effectiveness, turnover and retention, reliability and punctuality, employee loyalty, company image), competitive advantage (e.g., diverse customers, customer loyalty and satisfaction, innovation, productivity, work ethic, safety), inclusive work culture, and ability awareness. Secondary benefits for people with disabilities included improved quality of life and income, enhanced self-confidence, expanded social network, and a sense of community. Conclusions There are several benefits to hiring people with disabilities. Further research is needed to explore how benefits may vary by type of disability, industry, and job type."}, "pico": {"P": "People with disabilities", "I": "Hiring people with disabilities", "C": "Not hiring people with disabilities", "O": "Benefits of hiring people with disabilities (e.g., profitability, competitive advantage, inclusive work culture, ability awareness, improved quality of life, enhanced self-confidence)"}, "publication_pmids": ["24288164", "9516291"], "pub_date": "2018/12/01"}

Extensive data on strategies to achieve remission have been published, and more recently, many of these data have been subject to systematic review and metaanalyses. This review compares data from metaanalyses and more recent trials on some of the therapies that may help to achieve remission. Strategies that have demonstrated improved rates of full remission in the treatment of depression include venlafaxine as initial antidepressant therapy, which has been shown to provide higher rates of remission when compared with serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. For patients who do not respond to initial medication treatment, treatments such as psychotherapy, exercise, light therapy, alternative medicines, and counselling have demonstrated benefits over placebo and may enhance remission rates when used in combination with antidepressants.

Here we performed a systematic review on DNA methylation-based biomarkers published in CRC, and discussed the current state of findings and future challenges. Based on the findings, we then provide a perspective on future studies. Genome-wide studies on DNA methylation revealed novel biomarkers as well as distinct subgroups that exist in CRC. For diagnostic purposes, the most independently validated genes to study further are VIM, SEPT9, ITGA4, OSM4, GATA4 and NDRG4. These hypermethylated biomarkers can even be combined with LINE1 hypomethylation and the performance of markers should be examined in comparison to FIT further to find sensitive combinations. In terms of prognostic markers, myopodin, KISS1, TMEFF2, HLTF, hMLH1, APAF1, BCL2 and p53 are independently validated. Most prognostic markers published lack both a multivariate analysis in comparison to clinical risk factors and the appropriate patient group who will benefit by adjuvant chemotherapy. Methylation of IGFBP3, mir148a and PTEN are found to be predictive markers for 5-FU and EGFR therapy respectively. For therapy prediction, more studies should focus on finding markers for chemotherapeutic drugs as majority of the patients would benefit. Translation of these biomarkers into clinical utility would require large-scale prospective cohorts and randomized clinical trials in future. Based on these findings and consideration we propose an avenue to introduce methylation markers into clinical practice in near future. For future studies, multi-omics profiling on matched tissue and non-invasive cohorts along with matched cohorts of adenoma to carcinoma is indispensable to concurrently stratify CRC and find novel, robust biomarkers. Moreover, future studies should examine the timing and heterogeneity of methylation as well as the difference in methylation levels between epithelial and stromal tissues."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with colorectal cancer", "I": "DNA methylation-based biomarkers", "C": "Standard diagnostic or prognostic methods", "O": "Improved diagnosis, screening, prognosis, treatment prediction in colorectal cancer"}, "publication_pmids": ["19033568", "23443801", "17908973", "18482589"], "pub_date": "2016/08/01"}

Varying incidence trends together with biological differences between the colorectal segments raise questions of whether lifestyle factors impact on the risk of cancer differently at colorectal subsites. We provide an updated overview of the risk of cancer at different colorectal subsites (proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum) according to BMI and physical activity to shed light on this issue. Cohort studies of colorectal cancer, published in English throughout 2010, were identified using PubMed. The risk estimates from 30 eligible studies were summarized for BMI and physical activity. A positive relationship was found between BMI and cancer for all colorectal subsites, but most pronounced for the distal colon [relative risk (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34-1.89]. For the proximal colon and rectum, the risk estimates were 1.24 (95% CI 1.08-1.42) and 1.23 (95% CI 1.02-1.48), respectively. Physical activity was related inversely to the risk of cancer at the proximal (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.70-0.83) and distal colon (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71-0.83). Such a relationship could not be established for the rectum (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88-1.08). In conclusion, the results suggest minor differences in the associations of BMI and the risk of cancer between the colorectal subsites. For physical activity, the association does not seem to differ between the colonic subsites, but a difference was observed between the colon and the rectum, perhaps indicating that different mechanisms are operating in the development of colon and rectal cancer."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with colorectal cancer", "I": "Body mass index (BMI) and physical activity", "C": "Comparison of different colorectal subsites (proximal colon, distal colon, rectum)", "O": "Risk of cancer at different colorectal subsites based on BMI and physical activity"}, "publication_pmids": ["17372247", "18199723", "16187280", "19383885", "15066919", "17206529", "15280637", "20858743", "17986716", "2364077", "17164362", "9214674", "7847643", "20719902", "18437512", "17111261", "14648711", "16132794", "12117878", "15386435", "16818856"], "pub_date": "2013/11/01"}

A systematic search of Pubmed, Embase, and PsycInfo (1980 through August 2014) was performed to identify longitudinal observational studies assessing correlates and/or predictors of clinical, functional, cognitive, and biological outcomes in EOP. Seventy-five studies were included in the review. Using multivariate models, the most replicated predictors of worse clinical, functional, cognitive, and biological outcomes in EOP were premorbid difficulties and symptom severity (especially of negative symptoms) at baseline. Longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) predicted worse clinical, functional, and cognitive outcomes. Higher risk of attempting suicide was predicted by greater severity of psychotic illness and of depressive symptoms at the first episode of psychosis. Age at onset and sex were not found to be relevant predictors of outcome in most multivariate models, whereas studies using bivariate analyses yielded inconsistent results. Lower intelligence quotient at baseline predicted lower insight at follow-up, worse functional outcomes, and a diagnostic outcome of schizophrenia. Biological predictors of outcome in EOP have been little studied and have not been replicated. Lower levels of antioxidants at baseline predicted greater brain volume changes and worse cognitive functioning at follow-up, whereas neuroimaging markers such as regional cortical thickness and gray matter volume at baseline predicted remission and better insight at follow-up, respectively. EOP patients with poorer premorbid adjustment and prominent negative symptoms at initial presentation are at risk of poor outcome. They should therefore be the target of careful monitoring and more intensive interventions to address whether the disease course can be modified in this especially severely affected group.

A comprehensive search of electronic bibliographic databases was conducted to identify intervention studies that reported outcomes relevant to patient participation for CALD groups. Two reviewers independently critically appraised the studies and abstracted data.

The effect of a decision aid and patient navigator interventions on communication with health providers was positive. While the use of a decisions aid successfully facilitated shared decision-making and patients' perception of treatment adherence, the use of patient navigators was ineffective. A computer support system was found to improve general patient participation; however little clarification of what this involved was provided.

The main objective of this study was to determine the applications, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ICBT. The authors conducted a systematic review to identify randomized controlled trials investigating CBT delivered via the internet for adult patient populations. Searches to identify studies investigating cost-effectiveness of ICBT were also conducted. Evidence status for each clinical application was determined using the American Psychologist Association criteria for empirically supported treatments. Of 1104 studies reviewed, 108 met criteria for inclusion, of which 103 reported on clinical efficacy and eight on cost-effectiveness. Results showed that ICBT has been tested for 25 different clinical disorders, whereas most randomized controlled trials have been aimed at depression, anxiety disorders and chronic pain. Internet-based treatments for depression, social phobia and panic disorder were classified as well-established, that is, meeting the highest level of criteria for evidence. Effect sizes were large in the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders, severe health anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, female sexual dysfunction, eating disorders, cannabis use and pathological gambling. For other clinical problems, effect sizes were small to moderate. Comparison to conventional CBT showed that ICBT produces equivalent effects. Cost-effectiveness data were relatively scarce but suggested that ICBT has more than 50% probability of being cost effective compared with no treatment or to conventional CBT when willingness to pay for an additional improvement is zero. Although ICBT is a promising treatment option for several disorders, it can only be regarded as a well-established treatment for depression, panic disorder and social phobia. It seems that ICBT is as effective as conventional CBT for respective clinical disorder, that is, if conventional CBT works then ICBT works.

However, only a few published studies exist in the literature comparing these two operation types, particularly its mid-term efficacy and safety. Furthermore, in those studies, even large sample trials, when compared, have elicited controversial results, making it inconvenient for clinicians to refer to them.

Articles indexed in the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, China Biological Medicine and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, as of March 2016, that met our criteria were searched. A total of 18 trials involving 3,040 patients were included in our final analysis. The most important results drawn from the present analysis were as follows: Insignificant differences were identified in the blood loss [weighted mean difference (WMD)=6.23; 95% confidence intervals (CI), -0.85 to 13.32; P=0.08], surgical time [standardized mean difference (SMD)=0.40; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.82; P=0.06], the time of hospital stay (SMD=0.05; 95% CI, -0.28 to 0.37; P=0.77) and the total complications rate [odds ratio (OR)=0.86; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.131; P=0.28] on a comparison of the two operation methods. By contrast, comparing CDA with ACDF, the CDA had higher Short Form survey (SF-36) scores (WMD=1.65; 95% CI, 0.61 to 2.69; P=0.002), a larger range of motion in the operation level (SMD=6.53; 95% CI, 3.89 to 9.17; P<0.0001), a higher rate of neurological improvement following the operation (OR=1.80; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.52; P=0.0006), a lower Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score of neck pain (WMD= 0.16; 95% CI, -0.28 to 0.05; P=0.006) and arm pain (WMD= 0.12; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.01; P=0.04). In addition, in the mid-term following the surgery, CDA had a lower Neck Disability Index (NDI; SMD=0.18; 95% CI, -0.28 to -0.07; P=0.001) and a lower reoperation rate of adjacent levels (OR=0.54; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; P=0.007) compared with ACDF.

Therefore, it is necessary to explore alternative techniques to improve patients' behavioural regulation with minimal undesirable effects. In this regard, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, which are based on applying changing magnetic fields or electric currents to interfere with cortical excitability, have revealed their usefulness in alleviating the symptomatology of several mental disorders. However, to our knowledge, there are no reviews that assess whether these techniques are useful for reducing violence proneness. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria using the following databases: PsycINFO, PubMed, Dialnet, Psicodoc, Web of Knowledge, and the Cochrane Library. We initially identified 3746 entries, and eventually included 56 publications. Most of the studies were unanimous in concluding that the application of these techniques over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was not sufficient to promote anger and irritability reductions in euthymic individuals of both genders. Nevertheless, the application of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, especially transcranial direct current stimulation, over the right PFC seemed to reduce violent reactions in these individuals by interfering with the interpretation of the unfavourable situations (e.g., threating signals) or inner states that evoked anger. In antisocial and pathological populations, the conclusions were provided by a few pilot studies with important methodological weaknesses. The main conclusion of these studies was that bilateral stimulation of the PFC satisfactorily reduced anger and irritability only in inmates, patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), people who suffered a closed-head injury, and agitated patients with Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, combining these techniques with risperidone considerably reduced aggressiveness in these patients. Therefore, it is necessary to be cautious about the benefits of these techniques to control anger, due the methodological weaknesses of these studies. Nonetheless, they offer valuable opportunities to prevent violence by designing new treatments combining brain stimulation with current strategies, such as psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, in order to promote lasting changes."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with violence proneness, including euthymic individuals of both genders, inmates, patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), people who suffered a closed-head injury, and agitated patients with Alzheimer's disease.", "I": "Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, especially transcranial direct current stimulation, over the right prefrontal cortex (PFC), and bilateral stimulation of the PFC.", "C": "No specific comparison group mentioned in the review.", "O": "Reduction in violent reactions, anger, and irritability in patients with violence proneness.

We present the results of a systematic review of pain and other outcomes following analgesic, anaesthetic and surgical interventions for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The evidence from this review supports the use of general anaesthesia combined with a femoral nerve block for surgery and postoperative analgesia, or alternatively spinal anaesthesia with local anaesthetic plus spinal morphine. The primary technique, together with cooling and compression techniques, should be supplemented with paracetamol and conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2-selective inhibitors, plus intravenous strong opioids (high-intensity pain) or weak opioids (moderate- to low-intensity pain)."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA)", "I": "General anaesthesia combined with a femoral nerve block for surgery and postoperative analgesia, or spinal anaesthesia with local anaesthetic plus spinal morphine", "C": "Standard care without the specified interventions", "O": "Effective management of postoperative pain, reduced pain levels, improved recovery outcomes"}, "publication_pmids": ["7976145", "9474633", "15377579", "8615108", "9278070", "11561502", "11300386", "12892188", "12514150", "9113177", "16551930", "10700786", "1471517", "9268795", "7618676", "15281539", "8874906", "11568201", "11682424", "15170931", "11743529", "11300387", "10992830", "15199081", "16651569", "10515023", "7706340", "15950853", "15869558", "12538372", "9623427", "1512910", "15534514", "8904263", "12243289", "15343531", "9119854", "11444449", "9223201", "14709460", "11915059", "15809948", "7710234", "9661553", "11685362", "12934203", "15650890", "12651665", "16152868", "15029544", "2573228", "8067218", "17453401", "9174453", "10204938", "8250310", "15673878", "10593465", "11392066", "8780277", "15539531", "11911518", "10866908", "11903080", "11744586", "15814754", "8943591", "8642030", "15567642", "1934205", "16116010", "2679331", "12678355", "18787258", "2771438", "15138774", "15502061", "15067655", "2649122", "9474632", "12590029", "15247111", "16095462", "12571296", "12243290", "16452738", "1632541", "11315787", "15741619", "12378360", "11323364", "10553834", "12585579", "15351417", "15067647", "8620638", "12083587", "9661552", "15728080", "15765454", "11861723", "7902225", "11949239", "15819764", "15083429"], "pub_date": "2008/10/01"}

A conceptual framework to classify noise interventions and health effects was developed. Evidence was thinly spread across source types, outcomes, and intervention types. Further, diverse intervention study designs, methods of analyses, exposure levels, and changes in exposure do not allow a meta-analysis of the association between changes in noise level and health outcomes, and risk of bias in most studies was high. However, 43 individual transport noise intervention studies were examined (33 road traffic; 7 air traffic; 3 rail) as to whether the intervention was associated with a change in health outcome. Results showed that many of the interventions were associated with changes in health outcomes irrespective of the source type, the outcome or intervention type (source, path or infrastructure).

So, the current systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess survival and clinical response of specific immunotherapy in patients with glioma. Generally, seven databases were searched to find eligible studies. Controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of specific immunotherapy in glioma were found eligible. After data extraction and risk of bias assessment, the data were analyzed based on the level of heterogeneity. Overall, 25 articles with 2964 patients were included. Generally, mean overall survival did not statistically improve in immunotherapy [median difference=1.51; 95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.16-3.17; p=0.08]; however, it was 11.16 months higher in passive immunotherapy (95% CI=5.69-16.64; p<0.0001). One-year overall survival was significantly higher in immunotherapy groups [hazard ratio (HR)=0.69; 95% CI=0.52-0.92; p=0.01]. As the hazard rate in the immunotherapy approach was 0.83 of the control group, 2-year overall survival was significantly higher in immunotherapy (HR=0.83; 95% CI=0.69-0.99; p=0.04). Three-year overall survival was significantly higher in immunotherapy as well (HR=0.67; 95% CI=0.48-0.92; p=0.01). Overall, median progression-free survival was significantly higher in immunotherapy (standard median difference=0.323; 95% CI=0.110-0.536; p=0.003). However, 1-year progression-free survival was not remarkably different between immunotherapy and control groups (HR=0.94; 95% CI=0.74-1.18; p=0.59).

Adherence to a restricted diet can reduce symptoms, which in turn leads to increased quality of life and well-being. The aim of this review was to assess the extent to which predictors of dietary adherence have been considered in studies relating to functional bowel disorders and following a restricted diet. This was done firstly by examining such studies which contained a measure or indicator of adherence, and then by examining predictors of adherence within and between studies. A search of PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases was performed during July 2014, with the search criteria including relevant terms such as gastrointestinal disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, diet, and adherence. Of an initial 7927 papers, 39 were suitable for inclusion. Fourteen of the 39 studies included had a structured measure or indicator of dietary adherence, and the remaining 25 mentioned adherence without any structured levels of adherence. There was little investigation into the predictors of adherence, with symptom relief or induction being the primary goal of most of the studies. This review indicates that predictors of dietary adherence are rarely considered in research regarding functional bowel disorders. Further investigation is needed into the variables which contribute to rates of adherence to restricted diets, and more rigorous research is needed to characterise those individuals most likely to be non-adherent.

The search strategy was tailored to each database.The 19 studies that met the inclusion criteria were conducted in either high income countries (HIC), low- income countries (LIC) and/or middle-income countries (MIC). The economic evaluations covered a wide range of interventions. Studies were grouped together by intended outcome or objective of each study. The data varied in quality. We found evidence of cost-effectiveness of community health worker (CHW) interventions in reducing malaria and asthma, decreasing mortality of neonates and children, improving maternal health, increasing exclusive breastfeeding and improving malnutrition, and positively impacting physical health and psychomotor development amongst children.Studies measured varied outcomes, due to the heterogeneous nature of studies included; a meta-analysis was not conducted. Outcomes included disease- or condition -specific outcomes, morbidity, mortality, and generic measures (e.g. disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)). Nonetheless, all 19 interventions were found to be either cost-effective or highly cost-effective at a threshold specific to their respective countries.There is a growing body of economic evaluation literature on cost-effectiveness of CHW interventions. However, this is largely for small scale and vertical programmes. There is a need for economic evaluations of larger and integrated CHW programmes in order to achieve the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goal agenda so that appropriate resources can be allocated to this subset of human resources for health.

Secondary care prevention strategies for patients often involves drug therapy that is expensive and can result in undesirable side effects. Therefore, it is potentially beneficial to utilise other strategies, such as diet, in the management of CHD. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effects of specific nutrients on progression of atherosclerosis, vascular function, haemostasis and inflammation in CHD patients. Results show substantial evidence for the efficacy of n-3 oils in reducing cardiovascular mortality and one mechanism may be related to the stabilisation of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, although the effects on progression of atherosclerosis, haemostatic activity and vascular inflammation remain equivocal. Promising data also exist for the efficacy of flavonoid-rich foods for improving endothelial function, although strong clinical endpoint evidence is lacking. The variation in the efficacy of certain nutrients in CHD patients may be explained by genetics, existing risk factors, psychosocial factors and methodological issues, although these are often not adequately taken into consideration. We conclude that there is a need to undertake more appropriately designed trials in specific clinical populations, controlling for additional lifestyle and risk factors, examining potential interactions with medications, and also establishing methods to increase compliance to dietary recommendations before specific nutrients can be widely prescribed for secondary prevention.

A systematic review identified population-based surveys with estimates of childhood myopia prevalence published by February 2015. Multilevel binomial logistic regression of log odds of myopia was used to examine the association with age, gender, urban versus rural setting and survey year, among populations of different ethnic origins, adjusting for study design factors. 143 published articles (42 countries, 374 349 subjects aged 1-18 years, 74 847 myopia cases) were included. Increase in myopia prevalence with age varied by ethnicity. East Asians showed the highest prevalence, reaching 69% (95% credible intervals (CrI) 61% to 77%) at 15 years of age (86% among Singaporean-Chinese). Blacks in Africa had the lowest prevalence; 5.5% at 15 years (95% CrI 3% to 9%). Time trends in myopia prevalence over the last decade were small in whites, increased by 23% in East Asians, with a weaker increase among South Asians. Children from urban environments have 2.6 times the odds of myopia compared with those from rural environments. In whites and East Asians sex differences emerge at about 9 years of age; by late adolescence girls are twice as likely as boys to be myopic. Marked ethnic differences in age-specific prevalence of myopia exist. Rapid increases in myopia prevalence over time, particularly in East Asians, combined with a universally higher risk of myopia in urban settings, suggest that environmental factors play an important role in myopia development, which may offer scope for prevention."}, "pico": {"P": "Children aged 1-18 years from various ethnic backgrounds", "I": "Global variations in childhood myopia prevalence over time", "C": "Comparison of myopia prevalence in different ethnic groups, age groups, and urban vs rural settings", "O": "Implications for aetiology and early prevention of childhood myopia"}, "publication_pmids": ["19933197", "21762431", "16638989", "21185080", "17037714", "18294691", "20973325", "15808262", "11867575", "3871613", "19506196", "11867576", "17277756", "10764850", "10375241", "12939289", "10764851", "20445117", "17035280", "10937558", "22041590", "16809384", "22273355", "17123622", "14985292"], "pub_date": "2016/07/01"}

Our review addressed test accuracy of Hybrid Capture II (HCII) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays based on studies with stronger designs and with more clinically relevant outcomes. We searched OvidMedline, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library for English language studies comparing both tests, published 1985-2012, with cervical dysplasia defined by the Bethesda classification. Meta-analysis provided pooled sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs); meta-regression identified sources of heterogeneity. From 29 reports, we found that the pooled sensitivity and specificity to detect high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) was higher for HCII than PCR (0.89 [CI: 0.89-0.90] and 0.85 [CI: 0.84-0.86] vs. 0.73 [CI: 0.73-0.74] and 0.62 [CI: 0.62-0.64]).

For HCII, using histology as a gold standard results in higher accuracy than using cytology (dOR = 2.87 [CI: 1.31-6.29]).

We systematically reviewed studies that experimentally manipulated the dishware size participants served themselves at a meal with and measured subsequent food intake. We used inverse variance meta-analysis, calculating the standardized mean difference (SMD) in food intake between smaller and larger dishware size conditions. Nine experiments from eight publications were eligible for inclusion. The majority of experiments found no significance difference in food intake when participants ate from smaller vs. larger dishware. With all available data included, analysis indicated a marginal effect of dishware size on food intake, with larger dishware size associated with greater intake. However, this effect was small and there was a large amount of heterogeneity across studies (SMD: -0.18, 95% confidence interval: -0.35, 0.00, I(2) = 77%).

In order to better understand patient preferences for CTC versus colonoscopy, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature. Data sources included published studies, abstracts and book chapters, in any language, with publication dates from 1995 through February 2012, and with prospective or retrospective enrollment of diagnostic or screening patients who had undergone both procedures and explicit assessment of their preference for colonoscopy versus CTC. A predefined algorithm identified eligible studies using computer and hand searches performed by two independent investigators. We used a mixed effects model to pool preference differences (defined as the proportion of subjects who preferred CTC minus the proportion who preferred colonoscopy for each study). Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria, totaling 5616 subjects. In 16 of these studies, patients preferred CTC over colonoscopy, while colonoscopy was preferred in three studies. Due to the high degree of heterogeneity, an overall pooled preference difference was not calculated. Stratified analysis revealed that studies published in radiology journals (preference difference 0.590 [95 % CI 0.485, 0.694]) seemed more likely than studies in gastroenterology (0.218 [-0.015-0.451]) or general medicine journals (-0.158 [-0.389-0.072]) to report preference for CTC (p<0.001). Studies by radiology authors showed a trend towards stronger preference for CTC compared with studies by gastroenterology authors. Symptomatic patients expressed no preference, but screening patients preferred CTC. There was no difference in preferences between studies using \"masked\" and \"unmasked\" preference ascertainment methods. Three studies featuring limited bowel preparations for CTC reported marked preference for CTC. There was no evidence of publication bias, while cumulative and exclusion analysis did not show any temporal trend or dominant study. Limitations included data heterogeneity and preference ascertainment limitations. In conclusion, most included studies reported preference for CTC. On stratified analysis, screening patients preferred CTC while diagnostic patients showed no preference.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating oral CHM alone or in combination with conventional therapies for primary insomnia were identified by searching English and Chinese publications and databases of clinical trial registration. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook 5.1. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.2.4. Seventy-nine trials (7886 participants) were finally included in the review, and 76 were included in the meta-analysis. Twenty-seven trials reported the methods of random sequence generation, and five of them used the allocation concealment. Blinding of participants and personnel were used in 10 studies. The main meta-analysis showed that CHM alone was more effective than placebo by reducing scores of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (mean difference, MD: -3.06, 95% confidence interval, CI: -5.14 to -0.98, I(2) = 97%) and benzodiazepine drugs (BZDs) (MD: -1.94, 95% CI: -2.45 to -1.43, I(2) = 96%).

Five intervention settings were identified (active travel, after school, classroom, physical education, and recess). Among these settings, a greater proportion of positive findings (ie, significant increase in PA) were found in the classroom (75%) and active travel (67%) settings. Additionally, a higher proportion of interventions implemented in these settings were of high methodological quality (active travel [33%] and classroom [33%]).

Recently, stem cell-based therapy for DM has shown considerable promise. Here, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of published clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stem cell therapy for both type 1 DM (T1DM) and type 2 DM (T2DM). The PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched up to November 2018. We employed a fixed-effect model using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) when no statistically significant heterogeneity existed. Otherwise, a random-effects statistical model was used. Twenty-one studies met our inclusion criteria: ten T1DM studies including 226 patients and eleven T2DM studies including 386 patients.

However, there was no significant change in fasting plasma glucose levels (MD, -0.52; 95% CI, -1.38 to 0.34). Subgroup analyses showed significant HbA1c and C-peptide improvements in patients with T1DM treated with bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (BM-HSCs), while there was no significant change in the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) group. In T2DM, HbA1c and insulin requirements decreased significantly after MSC transplantation, and insulin requirements and C-peptide levels were significantly improved after bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) treatment.

Many efforts were made to lessen the side effects of doxorubicin and improve its efficacy.

In this narrative review, we aim to provide a holistic perspective by synthesizing and evaluating existing evidence, discussing key biological mechanisms, exploring the history of probiotic use, and appreciating the influence of modern diet on mental health. Five online databases were searched for relevant studies up to December 2017. Systematic reviews that included randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of depressive symptoms were included. Seven systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Three of these reviews conducted meta-analyses, out of which, two concluded that probiotics improved depressive symptoms in the sample population. Out of the four reviews that conducted qualitative analysis, three reviews concluded that probiotics have the potential to be used as a treatment. Due to the differences in clinical trials, a definitive effect of probiotics on depressive symptoms cannot be concluded. Nonetheless, probiotics seem to potentially produce a significant therapeutic effect for subjects with pre-existing depressive symptoms.

A total of 30 studies met our inclusion criteria: 13 on insoles, seven on TENS, six on NMES, and four on bracing. The standardised mean difference (SMD) in pain after treatment with TENS was 1.796, which represented a significant reduction in pain. The significant overall effect estimate for NMES on pain was similar to that of TENS, with a SMD of 1.924. The overall effect estimate of insoles on pain was a SMD of 0.992. The overall effect of bracing showed a significant reduction in pain of 1.34. Overall, all four non-operative modalities of treatment were found to have a significant effect on the reduction of pain in OA of the knee.

The purpose of this Evidence Analysis Library (EAL) guideline is to provide an evidence-based summary of nutrition therapy for the management of HTN in adults aged 18 years or older. Implementation of this guideline aims to promote evidence-based practice decisions by registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs), and other collaborating health professionals to decrease or manage HTN in adults while enhancing patient quality of life and taking into account individual preferences. The systematic review and guideline development methodology of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics were applied. A total of 70 research studies were included, analyzed, and rated for quality by trained evidence analysts (literature review dates ranged between 2004 and 2015). Evaluation and synthesis of related evidence resulted in the development of nine recommendations. To reduce BP in adults with HTN, there is strong evidence to recommend provision of medical nutrition therapy by an RDN, adoption of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension dietary pattern, calcium supplementation, physical activity as a component of a healthy lifestyle, reduction in dietary sodium intake, and reduction of alcohol consumption in heavy drinkers. Increased intake of dietary potassium and calcium as well as supplementation with potassium and magnesium for lowering BP are also recommended (fair evidence). Finally, recommendations related to lowering BP were formulated on vitamin D, magnesium, and the putative role of alcohol consumption in moderate drinkers (weak evidence).

We included controlled field studies and pretest-posttest studies, evaluating all types of CPOE systems, drugs and clinical settings. We present the results in evidence tables, calculate the risk ratio with 95% confidence interval and perform subgroup analyses for categorical factors, such as the level of care, patient group, type of drug, type of system, functionality of the system, comparison group type, study design, and the method for detecting errors. Of the 25 studies that analysed the effects on the medication error rate, 23 showed a significant relative risk reduction of 13% to 99%. Six of the nine studies that analysed the effects on potential ADEs showed a significant relative risk reduction of 35% to 98%. Four of the seven studies that analysed the effect on ADEs showed a significant relative risk reduction of 30% to 84%. Reporting quality and study quality was often insufficient to exclude major sources of bias. Studies on home-grown systems, studies comparing electronic prescribing to handwriting prescribing, and studies using manual chart review to detect errors seem to show a higher relative risk reduction than other studies. Concluding, it seems that electronic prescribing can reduce the risk for medication errors and ADE. However, studies differ substantially in their setting, design, quality, and results.

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A systematic search of both randomized (RCTs) and nonrandomized (non-RCT) studies was performed on PubMed Medline, OVID, EMBASE, and SCOPUS, without restrictions in language and publication type. Random-effects models were utilized and pooled estimates were reported as the relative risk (RR) ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). Tests for heterogeneity as well as meta-regression, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS A total of 29 studies (22 RCTs, 7 non-RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis. The overall RR of acquiring an SSI was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.55-0.77; I2=42.4%, P=.01) in favor of TCS use. The pooled RR was particularly lower for the abdominal surgery group (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.41-0.77) and was robust to sensitivity analysis.

In this article, we quantified the contribution of NO in FMD of conduit arteries and explored the effect of the protocol (ie, distal cuff, ≈5-minute ischemia) and method of analysis (ie, automated and continuous edge detection) on the NO dependency of this test. A systematic review and 3-stage meta-analysis of published crossover studies that measured FMD under local infusion of saline or the NO synthase blocker N(G)monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) was undertaken. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria for stage 1 (374 individual comparisons). The meta-analyzed outcome was the difference in FMD between infusion of saline (ie, FMD(saline)) and NO synthase blocker (ie, FMD(L-NMMA)). Overall, FMD(saline) was 8.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.8%-9.6%) compared with FMD(L-NMMA) of 3.7% (95% CI, 3.1%-4.3%; P<0.001).

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies to investigate this issue.

{"id": "MLSEP000509", "origin": {"pmid": "27979049", "title": "Medical Management of Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis: Expert Review from the Clinical Practice Updates Committee of the AGA Institute.", "abstract": "The purpose of this clinical practice update is to review diagnostic criteria for severe acute alcoholic hepatitis and to determine the current best practices for this life-threatening condition. The best practices in this review are based on clinical trials, systematic reviews including meta-analysis and expert opinion to develop an approach to diagnosis and management. Best Practice Advice 1: Abstinence from drinking alcohol is the cornerstone of treatment for alcohol hepatitis (AH). Best Practice Advice 2: Patients with jaundice and suspected AH should have cultures of blood, urine, and ascites, if present, to determine the presence of bacterial infections regardless of whether they have fever. Best Practice Advice 3: Patients with AH who have jaundice should be admitted to the hospital to encourage abstinence, restore adequate nutrition, and exclude serious infections. Best Practice Advice 4: Imaging of the liver is warranted as part of the evaluation, but caution should be used in administering iodinated contrast dye, as it increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Best Practice Advice 5: Patients with AH require a diet with 1-1.5 g protein and 30-40 kcal/kg body weight for adequate recovery. If the patient is unable to eat because of anorexia or altered mental status, a feeding tube should be considered for enteral feeding. Parenteral nutrition alone is inadequate. Best Practice Advice 6: Severity and prognosis of AH should be evaluated using Maddrey Discriminant Function (MDF), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), age, bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and creatinine (ABIC), or Glasgow scoring systems. Current treatments are based on this assessment. Best Practice Advice 7: Presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) on admission is associated with an increased risk of multi-organ failure (MOF) syndrome. Development of MOF, usually due to infections developing after initial diagnosis of AH, is associated with a very high mortality rate. Best Practice Advice 8: Nephrotoxic drugs, including diuretics, should be avoided or used sparingly in patients with AH, since AKI is an early manifestation of MOF. Best Practice Advice 9: Patients with MDF > 32 or MELD score > 20 without a contraindication to glucocorticoid, such as hepatitis B viral infection, tuberculosis, or other serious infectious diseases, may be treated with methylprednisolone 32 mg daily, but the appropriate duration of treatment remains a subject of controversy. Methylprednisolone does not improve survival beyond 28 days, and the benefits for < 28 days are modest. Best Practice Advice 10: Patients with a contraindication to glucocorticoids may be treated with pentoxifylline 400 mg three times daily with meals. Data regarding the efficacy are conflicting. Best Practice Advice 11: Patients with severe AH, particularly those with a MELD score > 26 with good insight into their alcohol use disorder and good social support should be referred for evaluation for liver transplantation, as the 90-day mortality rate is very high. Best Practice Advice 12: Patients with mild to moderate AH defined by a MELD score < 20 and MDF < 32 should be referred for abstinence counseling and prescribed a high protein diet supplemented with B vitamins and folic acid."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis", "I": "Medical management including abstinence from alcohol, diagnostic testing, imaging, nutritional support, glucocorticoids or pentoxifylline treatment, and liver transplantation evaluation", "C": "Standard care or alternative treatments for severe acute alcoholic hepatitis", "O": "Improved survival, reduced risk of multi-organ failure, improved liver function, reduced mortality rate, improved quality of life"}, "publication_pmids": ["14672612", "26764182", "11113085", "21400552", "15607127", "1992635", "24026598", "19340904", "23029716", "18721242", "15046213", "15122768", "18848937", "19445945", "2648927", "8964410", "17311624", "1475038", "22070475", "17518367", "10869286", "17532088", "8523623"], "pub_date": "2017/01/01"}

Depression has been associated with poorer quality of life, in addition to increased impairment of immune response and poorer survival in cancer patients. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the efficacy of interventions for cancer patients with depression have failed to distinguish between caseness for depression and depressive symptoms. The findings from this systematic review show that there is limited trial data on the efficacy of prescribed antidepressants in reducing the incidence of major depression and depressive symptoms in cancer patients. Contrary to previous reviews that failed to distinguish between depressive symptoms and depression, this review found very little data from clinical trials (without the possibility of confounding factors) to demonstrate that psychotherapeutic interventions are effective in reducing depression in cancer patients. A number of small-scale, single-centre trials indicated that psychotherapeutic interventions (especially cognitive behavioural therapy) can have effects on depressive symptoms in cancer patients. However, given the methodological limitations of studies to date, lack of evidence should not be interpreted as implying lack of efficacy.

Sleep deprivation in ICU patients has been already studied and negative effects on their outcome (prolonged ICU stay, decreased recovery) and complication rates (incidence of delirium, neuropsychological sequels of critical illness) discussed. Several interventions potentially improving the sleep disturbance in ICU (sleep-promotion strategies) have been assumed and tested for clinical practice. We present a review of recent literature focused on chosen types of non-pharmacological interventions (earplugs and eye mask) analysing their effect on sleep quality/quantity.

Most of the reviewed studies showed a significant improvement of subjective sleep quality when using described non-pharmacological interventions (objective parameters were not significantly validated). Measuring the sleep quality is a major concern limiting the objective comparison of the studies' results since non-standardised (and mainly individual) tools for sleep quality assessment were used.

Growing out of an increasing awareness of this problem, the evidence-based medicine (EBM) movement sought to empower clinicians to find the evidence most relevant to a specific clinical question. Various organizations have used EBM techniques to develop systematic reviews and practice guidelines to aid physicians in making evidence-based decisions. A systematic review follows a process of asking a clinical question, finding the relevant evidence, critically appraising the evidence and formulating conclusions and recommendations. Results are mixed on whether educating physicians about evidence-based recommendations is sufficient to change physician behavior.

We sought to compare the efficacy of commonly used silver delivery approaches including nanocrystalline silver, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing, and silver-impregnated foam dressing as the main products in the management of partial thickness burns. A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and other databases to identify relevant randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Due to the paucity of direct head-to-head trials, an indirect treatment comparison was performed. The use of nanocrystalline silver was associated with a statistically significant reduction in length of stay when compared to silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing (p = 0.027) and a shorter time to healing when compared to silver-impregnated foam dressing (p = 0.0328). There were no statistically significant differences in infection rates and surgical procedures between nanocrystalline silver, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing, and silver-impregnated foam dressing; however, nanocrystalline silver was found to be the most beneficial for all the outcomes, including infection rates and surgical procedures, according to the Monte Carlo simulation method. In conclusion, current evidence from the published literature suggests that where the clinical and microbiological priority is to get in control of infection quickly it would seem prudent to use the most potent silver delivery system, which is nanocrystalline silver.

Additional information on internal motion can be obtained by cone beam computer tomography or tomotherapy and if available its use should be considered.

This burgeoning field remains highly controversial with empirically-backed disagreements at all levels of evidence, including individual studies, systematic reviews, and even meta-analyses. The current study investigated the effect of a randomized six week online working memory intervention on untrained cognitive abilities in a community-recruited sample of healthy young adults, in relation to both a processing speed training active control condition, as well as a no-contact control condition. Results of traditional null hypothesis significance testing, as well as Bayesian factor analyses, revealed support for the null hypothesis across all cognitive tests administered before and after training. Importantly, all three groups were similar at pre-training for a variety of individual variables purported to moderate transfer of training to fluid intelligence, including personality traits, motivation to train, and expectations of cognitive improvement from training. Because these results are consistent with experimental trials of equal or greater methodological rigor, we suggest that future research re-focus on: 1) other promising interventions known to increase memory performance in healthy young adults, and; 2) examining sub-populations or alternative populations in which working memory training may be efficacious."}, "pico": {"P": "Healthy young adults", "I": "Working memory training", "C": "Active and passive control groups", "O": "Effect on untrained cognitive abilities"}, "publication_pmids": ["2967376", "18999354", "25716189", "4557999", "12482077", "23516294", "27280448"], "pub_date": "2017/01/01"}

The databases Medline and Embase were searched using MeSH terms and keywords for influenza, POCT, antivirals, antibiotics, and length of stay. Amongst 245 studies screened, 30 were included. The majority of papers reporting on antiviral prescription found that a positive POCT result significantly increased use of antivirals for influenza compared with negative POCT results and standard supportive care. A positive POCT result also led to decreased antibiotic use. The results of studies assessing the effect of POCT on ED length of stay were not definitive. The studies assessed in this systematic review support the use of POCT for diagnosis of influenza in patients suffering an acute respiratory infection.

Our aim was to evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of pregabalin in postoperative pain management. We included randomized clinical trials investigating perioperative pregabalin treatment in adult surgical patients. The review followed Cochrane methodology, including Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), and used trial sequential analyses (TSAs). The primary outcomes were 24 h morphine i.v. consumption and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) defined by International Conference of Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Conclusions were based primarily on trials with low risk of bias. Ninety-seven randomized clinical trials with 7201 patients were included. The 24 h morphine i.v. consumption was reported in 11 trials with overall low risk of bias, finding a reduction of 5.8 mg (3.2, 8.5; TSA adjusted confidence interval: 3.2, 8.5). Incidence of SAEs was reported in 21 trials, with 55 SAEs reported in 12 of these trials, and 22 SAEs reported in 10 trials with overall low risk of bias. In trials with overall low risk of bias, Peto's odds ratio was 2.9 (1.2, 6.8; TSA adjusted confidence interval: 0.1, 97.1).

There have been several studies over the last years on peripheral nerve block using high-frequency alternating currents, which could become a therapeutic alternative for such nerve hyperactivity. The main aim of this systematic review was to determine the optimal parameters of the electrical currents for producing peripheral nerve conduction block, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, and their possible adverse effects. Of the 49 included studies, 30 were animal experiments, 13 were computer simulations, and six were clinical trials. High-frequency alternating currents using frequencies of >4-5 kHz effectively block nerve conduction. However, depending on the type of axon or nerve diameter, the minimum frequency required to produce the nerve block could be >20kHz. Electrodes design, electrode-axon distance, and temperature are variables that affect the block threshold.

Tight glycemic control with intensive insulin therapy has been suggested to reduce the risk of such complications in several diabetes populations; however, such an approach can also be associated with risks and challenges. There are currently several modalities available to deliver insulin and monitor glucose levels to achieve glycemic goals in diabetic patients. In July 2012, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published a systematic review on the comparative effectiveness of insulin delivery systems and glucose-monitoring modalities in diabetic patients receiving intensive insulin therapy. Studies from 44 publications included in the review compared the effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with multiple daily injections (MDI) and/or real time-continuous glucose monitoring (rt-CGM) with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) among children, adolescents, or adults with either type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM), or pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes (either T1DM or T2DM). This comparative effectiveness review evaluated which modality results in improved glycemic control, less hypoglycemia, better quality of life, and/or improved clinical outcomes. The numerous technologies and the challenges that clinicians face when determining which patient population may benefit from different insulin delivery systems and glucose-monitoring approaches motivated AHRQ to synthesize the available information to assist health professionals in making evidence-based practice decisions for their patients. The review also delineates advances in insulin delivery and glucose-monitoring systems, practical methods to achieve tight glycemic control and strategies to minimize associated risks, as well as highlights gaps in research and areas that need to be addressed in the future. "}, "pico": {"P": "Diabetic patients receiving intensive insulin therapy", "I": "Insulin delivery systems and glucose-monitoring modalities", "C": "Comparison between continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with multiple daily injections (MDI) and/or real time-continuous glucose monitoring (rt-CGM) with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)", "O": "Improved glycemic control, less hypoglycemia, better quality of life, and/or improved clinical outcomes"}, "publication_pmids": ["2699706", "15735183", "18466210", "16433711", "17848840", "3064030", "20711715", "11574432", "2713649", "20587585", "10977011", "12401759", "15220227", "15983302", "9764259", "17610805", "19396424", "21294770", "16026370", "17535290", "19885096", "17315527", "19132857", "14513883", "18006209", "12949284", "18036064", "18307459", "18445730", "18715214", "2945155"], "pub_date": "2012/08/01"}

The clinical outcomes of the trials were analyzed by Lachman test, pivot-shift test, International Knee Documentation Committee knee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Mean difference or risk ratio with 95% confidence interval was calculated using a fixed-effects or random-effects model. Heterogeneity across the studies was also assessed.

Our systematic review suggests supervised ET has an inconsistent effect on exercise capacity and QoL when compared to control groups undergoing usual care. A quantitative sub-analysis was performed with 4 studies that provided enough data to compare peak oxygen uptake and QoL at baseline and at follow-up. After at least 6 weeks of training, LVAD patients undergoing supervised ET demonstrated significant improvement in exercise capacity (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.735, 95% Confidence Interval-[CI], 0.31-1.15 units of the standard deviation, P = 0.001) and QoL scores (SMD = 1.58, 95% CI 0.97-2.20 units of the standard deviation, P <0.001) when compared to the usual care group, with no serious adverse events with exercise.

Risk of bias and clinical relevance were assessed, and outcomes were analysed through meta-analysis. From a total of 3,105 citations, 10 studies adhered to the a priori eligibility criteria. These included 1,095 people; 535 participants were allocated to receive LWI insoles compared to 509 in control groups. Eight per cent of papers were of high quality with low risk of bias.

Pancreatic enzyme supplementation is widely used to treat pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis, despite little evidence for efficacy. We performed a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis to investigate its effectiveness. Methods. All randomized controlled parallel or crossover trials in patients with chronic pancreatitis comparing pancreatic enzyme supplementation to placebo were included. The main outcome was improvement in pain score or reduced analgesic consumption. Two independent reviewers extracted data. Mantel-Haenszel random effect model meta-analysis was used whenever methodologically appropriate. Results. Five out of 434 retrieved studies were included in the systematic review. All studies used relatively similar methodology. Four studies using enteric-coated pancreatic enzyme supplementation failed to show any improvement in pain as compared to placebo. The only study using non-enteric-coated enzymes did show reduction in the pain score. There was significant heterogeneity among studies in both analyses. Random model meta-analysis of three studies showed no significant difference in the mean of daily pain score (mean difference: 0.09 (1.57-1.39), p = 0.91) or average weekly analgesic consumption (mean difference: -0.30 (-2.37-1.77), p = 0.77) between the periods of administering pancreatic enzyme supplementation versus placebo.

It has been approved for use around the world. Over the period of its development, a number of different formulations were introduced. In 1999, a systematic review of SCG use in childhood asthma was carried out and reported initially as a poster. Further systematic reviews and papers followed from the same authors and finally a Cochrane Collaboration review was published in 2003. All concluded that SCG was ineffective in paediatric asthma. Both the British Thoracic Society Guidelines for the treatment of paediatric asthma and the Model List of Essential Drugs of the WHO now reflect these conclusions. This paper looks carefully at the conclusions of these systematic reviews and raises concerns about the interpretation of the results. These failed to take adequate account of the changes with time in both the formulations used and the age groups examined, and also failed to take adequate note of the totality of information available over all end-points. One primary end-point was based on only four out of the 24 studies included in the review. Rather than having no effect, it is demonstrated that a considerable body of evidence favours SCG compared to placebo and, far from being ineffective, the drug appears to be effective particularly in older children.

This systematic review critically evaluated the short-term health effects of air pollution in persons living with CAD. Original research articles were retrieved systematically through searching electronic databases (e.g., Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE)), cross-referencing, and the authors' knowledge. From 2884 individual citations, 26 eligible articles were identified. The majority of the investigations (18 of 22 (82%)) revealed a negative relationship between air pollutants and cardiac function or overall health. Heart rate variability (HRV) was the primary cardiovascular outcome measure, with 10 out of 13 studies reporting at least one index of HRV being significantly affected by air pollutants. However, there was some inconsistency in the relationship between HRV and air pollutants, mediated (at least in part) by the confounding effects of beta-blocker medications. In conclusion, there is strong evidence that air pollution can have adverse effects on cardiovascular function in persons living with CAD. All persons living with CAD should be educated on how to monitor air quality, should recognize the potential risks of excessive exposure to air pollution, and be aware of strategies to mitigate these risks. Persons living with CAD should minimize their exposure to air pollution by limiting outdoor physical activity participation when the forecast air quality health index indicates increased air pollution (i.e., an increased risk)."}, "pico": {"P": "Persons living with coronary artery disease (CAD)", "I": "Exposure to air pollution", "C": "No exposure to air pollution or lower levels of air pollution", "O": "Short-term health effects on cardiovascular function, specifically heart rate variability (HRV)"}, "publication_pmids": ["10982537", "15591973", "20962342", "15923279", "10545309", "5803182", "12641604", "9764259", "15703529", "8179653", "22693269", "7881654", "17855668", "2382916"], "pub_date": "2019/02/24"}

In May 2016, WHO Geneva searched the Cochrane Library and PubMed for systematic reviews of interventions including physical activity to prevent childhood obesity or risk factors for obesity-related NCDs. Using a narrative synthesis, the efficacy of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to alter energy balance outcomes (measures of weight status or body fatness) was characterized by life-course stage, study characteristics, intervention functions (as defined in the behaviour change wheel), and level of the socio-ecological model (SEM) targeted. The quality of included systematic reviews was assessed. We retrieved 82 reviews from the World Health Organization (WHO) search, of which 23 were eligible for the present synthesis. The number of eligible studies by life-course stage was: 0 (peri-conception); 0 (pregnancy); 8 (infancy and toddlerhood, age 0 to 23 months; seven RCTs; age); and 37 (early childhood, age 24 to 59 months; 30 RCTs;). Thus, there was a lack of evidence for physical activity interventions during peri-conception and pregnancy. Almost all relevant studies in the 0- to 23- and 24- to 59-month life-course stages were multicomponent interventions (ie, targeted physical activity, dietary, and/or sedentary behaviours). Interventions with evidence of efficacy tended to target multiple levels of the SEM, with emphasis on parents, and extend over long periods. Effective intervention elements for early life obesity prevention included classes on parenting skills, alteration of the kindergarten playground, and financial incentives. Evidence from low- and middle-income countries was scarce, and evidence for intervention effect on obesity-related NCDs was missing. Future physical activity interventions in toddlerhood and early childhood aimed at prevention of obesity should adopt the characteristics typical of effective interventions identified by the present synthesis.

We systematically review the empirical research published in the past decade (from January 2004 to February 2015) on acute and chronic effects of cannabis and cannabinoids and on persistence or recovery after abstinence. We summarize the findings into the major categories of the cognitive domains investigated, considering sample characteristics and associations with various cannabis use parameters. Verbal learning and memory and attention are most consistently impaired by acute and chronic exposure to cannabis. Psychomotor function is most affected during acute intoxication, with some evidence for persistence in chronic users and after cessation of use. Impaired verbal memory, attention, and some executive functions may persist after prolonged abstinence, but persistence or recovery across all cognitive domains remains underresearched. Associations between poorer performance and a range of cannabis use parameters, including a younger age of onset, are frequently reported. Little further evidence has emerged for the development of tolerance to the acutely impairing effects of cannabis.

{"id": "MLSEP000719", "origin": {"pmid": "22855269", "title": "Clinical evidence of herbal drugs as perpetrators of pharmacokinetic drug interactions.", "abstract": "The use of herbal/botanical products, also referred to as complementary and alternative medicines (CAM), worldwide enjoys increasing popularity. It appears in particular highly prevalent in patient populations already exposed to complex treatment algorithms and polypharmacotherapy, frequently involving narrow therapeutic index drugs. Accordingly, the potential clinical dimension and relevance of herb-drug interactions has received considerable attention over the last years. However, review of pertinent literature indicates that the available clinical evidence in this regard is still limited and sometimes inconclusive. Also, communication of herb-drug interaction data in the biopharmaceutical/medical literature is often complex and confusing, not always unbiased, and in many cases appears not to strive for clear-cut and useful guidance in terms of the clinical relevance of such findings.This systematic review summarizes and interprets the published evidence on clinical herb-drug interaction studies which examined the potential of six popular herbal drugs (Echinacea, garlic, gingko, ginseng, goldenseal, and milk thistle) as perpetrators of pharmacokinetic (PK) drug interactions. Reported effect sizes were systematically categorized according to FDA drug interaction guideline criteria. A total of 66 clinical PK interaction studies, meeting the scope of the present review, were identified. The clinical evidence was found to be most robust and informative for Gingko biloba (GB; 21 studies) and milk thistle/silymarin (MT; 13), and appears still limited for ginseng (9), goldenseal/berberine (GS; 8), garlic (8), and Echinacea (7). Collectively, the available evidence indicates that, at commonly recommended doses, none of these herbs act as potent or moderate inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or P-glycoprotein (ABCB1).

Included studies utilized an all-out or endurance-based exercise protocol (no team-based performance studies) and featured randomized interventions and placebo (water-only) trial for comparison against exclusively CHO trials (no other ingredients). Of the 61 included published performance studies (n = 679 subjects), 82% showed statistically significant performance benefits (n = 50 studies), with 18% showing no change compared with placebo. There was a significant (p = 0.0036) correlative relationship between increasing total exercise time and the subsequent percent increase in performance with CHO intake versus placebo. While not mutually exclusive, the primary mechanism(s) for performance enhancement likely differs depending on the duration of the exercise. In short duration exercise situations (∼1 h), oral receptor exposure to CHO, via either mouthwash or oral consumption (with enough oral contact time), which then stimulates the pleasure and reward centers of the brain, provide a central nervous system-based mechanism for enhanced performance. Thus, the type and (or) amount of CHO and its ability to be absorbed and oxidized appear completely irrelevant to enhancing performance in short duration exercise situations. For longer duration exercise (>2 h), where muscle glycogen stores are stressed, the primary mechanism by which carbohydrate supplementation enhances performance is via high rates of CHO delivery (>90 g/h), resulting in high rates of CHO oxidation.

While it is generally believed that loss of meniscal tissue leads to osteoarthritis and poor knee function, many variables may significantly influence this outcome. Through literature search engines including PubMed and Ovid, 4 randomized controlled trials, 2 prospective cohorts, and 23 retrospective cohorts that fit the criteria for level I, II, and III level of evidence were included in this systematic review. For the level III evidence studies, follow-up of 5 years or more was required. Preoperative and intraoperative predictors of poor clinical or radiographic outcomes included total meniscectomy or removal of the peripheral meniscal rim, lateral meniscectomy, degenerative meniscal tears, presence of chondral damage, presence of hand osteoarthritis suggestive of genetic predisposition, and increased body mass index. Variables that were not predictive of outcome or were inconclusive or had mixed results included meniscal tear pattern, age, mechanical alignment, sex of patient, activity level, and meniscal tears associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. While an intact meniscus or meniscal repair was generally favorable in the ACL-reconstructed knees, meniscal repair of degenerative meniscal tissue was not favorable. There is a lack of uniformity in the literature on this subject with a preponderance of lower level evidence. Although randomized controlled trials are considered to be the gold standard in medical research, a multicenter prospective cohort design may be more appropriate in assessing the long-term outcome of meniscal surgery and the role that multiple preoperative and intraoperative variables may play in clinical outcomes. In addition, future studies should include factors not assessed or adequately evaluated by several of the included studies, such as meniscal tear pattern, age, mechanical alignment, sex of the patient, activity level, meniscal tears associated with other injuries such as the ACL, smoking, and the effect of previous surgery."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients undergoing meniscectomy", "I": "Meniscectomy procedure", "C": "Comparison of different variables influencing outcomes", "O": "Clinical outcomes in patients undergoing meniscectomy"}, "publication_pmids": ["17216272", "3818740", "1428307", "8291156", "12975192", "10755429", "27743058", "18784099"], "pub_date": "2010/09/01"}

This mutation most notably affects the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. Excess salt absorption by defective CFTR dehydrates the airway lining and leads to defective mucociliary clearance. Consequent accumulation of thick, sticky mucus makes the airway prone to chronic infection and progressive inflammation; respiratory failure often ensues. Additionally, abnormalities with CFTR lead to systemic complications like malnutrition, diabetes and subfertility.Since the discovery of the causative gene, our understanding of the structure and function of CFTR and the impact of different mutations has increased and allowed pharmaceutical companies to design new mutation-specific therapies targeting the underlying molecular defect. Therapies targeting mutation classes III and IV (CFTR potentiators) aim to normalise airway surface liquid and help re-establish mucociliary clearance, which then has a beneficial impact on the chronic infection and inflammation that characterizes lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis.

The members of the Working Group first examined existing research evidence from the national and international literature and main international guidelines. They considered as universally accepted the usefulness/effectiveness of unilateral cochlear implantation in severely-profoundly adult patients. Accordingly, they focused their attention on the systematic reviews addressing clinical effectiveness and cost/efficacy of CI procedures, with particular regard to the most controversial issues for which international consensus is still lacking. The following aspects were evaluated: monolateral CI in advanced-age adult patients; bilateral (simultaneous/sequential) CI vs. unilateral CI and vs. bimodal stimulation; benefits derived from the monolateral CI procedure in adult patients with prelingual deafness. With regard to CI in elderly patients, the selected studies document an improvement of the quality of life and perceptive abilities after CI, even if the benefits were found to be inferior in patients over 70 years at the time of surgery. Thus, from the results of the studies included in the review, advanced age is not a contraindication for the CI procedure. With respect to unilateral CI, bilateral CI offers advantages in hearing in noise, in sound localization and less during hearing in a silent environment. However, high interindividual variability is reported in terms of benefits from the second implant.

Therefore, in this paper, a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies regarding protein consumption and T2DM risk are conducted in order to present the association between them. We searched the PubMed and Embase databases for cohort studies on dietary protein, high-protein food consumption and risk of T2DM, up to July 2017. A summary of relative risks was compiled by the fixed-effect model or random-effect model. Eleven cohort studies regarded protein intake and T2DM (52,637 cases among 483,174 participants). The summary RR and 95% CI (Confidence Interval) of T2DM was 1.12 (1.08-1.17) in all subjects, 1.13 (1.04-1.24) in men, and 1.09 (1.04-1.15) in women for total protein;1.14 (1.09-1.19) in all subjects, 1.23 (1.09-1.38) in men, and 1.11 (1.03-1.19) in women for animal protein; 0.96 (0.88-1.06) in all subjects, 0.98 (0.72-1.34) in men, and 0.92 (0.86-0.98) in women for plant protein. We also compared the association between different food sources of protein and the risk of T2DM. The summary RR (Relative Risk) and 95% CI of T2DM was 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for red meat, 1.39 (1.29-1.49) for processed meat, 1.03 (0.89-1.17) for fish, 1.03 (0.64-1.67) for egg, 0.89 (0.84-0.94) for total dairy products, 0.87 (0.78-0.96) for whole milk, 0.83 (0.70-0.98) for yogurt, 0.74 (0.59-0.93) in women for soy. This meta-analysis shows that total protein and animal protein could increase the risk of T2DM in both males and females, and plant protein decreases the risk of T2DM in females. The association between high-protein food types and T2DM are also different. Red meat and processed meat are risk factors of T2DM, and soy, dairy and dairy products are the protective factors of T2DM. Egg and fish intake are not associated with a decreased risk of T2DM.

Methodological quality was assessed by the EPHPP quality assessment tool. A total of 10 eligible studies were identified. Due to big heterogeneity, quantitative synthesis was not feasible.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of statins and/or fibrates on prevention and progression of DR. We conducted a Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported in accordance to PRISMA Statement. GRADE approach was used to summarize the certainty of the evidence. Eight RCTs that fulfilled our eligibility criteria were included, assessing the effects of fibrates (n = 4), statins (n = 3) and fibrate plus statins (n = 1) for therapy (n = 8) or prevention (n = 4) of DR. Overall, the main concern regarding risk of bias assessment was due to incomplete outcome data because high rate of losses in five RCTs. Furthermore, the risk of reporting bias was rated unclear due the lack of previously published protocol in seven RCTs.

After data extraction, the potential risk of bias was estimated depending on the study types, and the level of evidence was evaluated. Regarding management of ECC, results are presented for silver diamine fluoride (SDF, n = 5), nonoperative caries management (NOCM, n = 10), and restorative approaches (RA, n = 8) separately, as different kinds of studies with different levels of evidence were found for the different aspects in the management of ECC. The 5 systematic reviews on SDF showed a high potential for arrest of ECC on a high level of evidence. In NOCM, a low level of evidence for a moderate effect of fluoride varnish in arresting or remineralizing, especially non-cavitated lesions, was assessed. For RA in carious anterior upper primary teeth, a low level of evidence was found for higher failure rates of glass ionomer cement and composite fillings than composite strip crowns even if placed under general anaesthesia and especially compared to other crowns (stainless steel and zirconia).

We included studies from database inception to September 2015. Studies must report on the effect of green tea consumption on PCa. The quality of observational studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), while randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed for quality using the Jadad scale. A total of 15 articles were included, with 11 reporting on the effect of green tea consumption on PCa prevention, and four reporting on the effect of green tea on treatment. Mean NOS for observational studies was 7.4 (SD±1.3), with a range from 6 to 9, while all three RCTs scored 5 on the Jadad scale. Findings demonstrate that green tea appears to be an effective chemopreventive agent, particularly in those with high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia.

Methods and Results A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCT s investigating paclitaxel-coated devices in the femoral and/or popliteal arteries was performed. The primary safety measure was all-cause patient death. Risk ratios and risk differences were pooled with a random effects model. In all, 28 RCT s with 4663 patients (89% intermittent claudication) were analyzed. All-cause patient death at 1 year (28 RCT s with 4432 cases) was similar between paclitaxel-coated devices and control arms (2.3% versus 2.3% crude risk of death; risk ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.72-1.61). All-cause death at 2 years (12 RCT s with 2316 cases) was significantly increased in the case of paclitaxel versus control (7.2% versus 3.8% crude risk of death; risk ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.15-2.47; -number-needed-to-harm, 29 patients [95% CI , 19-59]). All-cause death up to 5 years (3 RCT s with 863 cases) increased further in the case of paclitaxel (14.7% versus 8.1% crude risk of death; risk ratio, 1.93; 95% CI , 1.27-2.93; -number-needed-to-harm, 14 patients [95% CI , 9-32]). Meta-regression showed a significant relationship between exposure to paclitaxel (dose-time product) and absolute risk of death (0.4±0.1% excess risk of death per paclitaxel mg-year; P<0.001). Trial sequential analysis excluded false-positive findings with 99% certainty (2-sided α, 1.0%).

There were 17 eligible studies. Six of eight randomised controlled trials found no significant differences between control and intervention groups (masks with or without hand hygiene; N95/P2 respirators). One household trial found that mask wearing coupled with hand sanitiser use reduced secondary transmission of upper respiratory infection/influenza-like illness/laboratory-confirmed influenza compared with education; hand sanitiser alone resulted in no reduction. One hospital-based trial found a lower rate of clinical respiratory illness associated with non-fit-tested N95 respirator use compared with medical masks.

In addition, the contribution of dietary sources was considered, suggesting tea, coffee, red wine, fruit and vegetables as the main products providing polyphenols. Total flavonoids and specific subclasses, but not total polyphenols, have been apparently associated with a low risk of diabetes, cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. However, large variability in terms of methods for the evaluation and quantification of polyphenol intake, markers and endpoints considered, makes it still difficult to establish an evidence-based reference intake for the whole class and subclass of compounds. Nevertheless, the critical mass of data available seem to strongly suggest the protective effect of a polyphenol-rich dietary pattern even if further well targeted and methodologically sound research should be encouraged in order to define specific recommendations."}, "pico": {"P": "Adult population with or at risk for chronic diseases", "I": "High polyphenol intake from tea, coffee, red wine, fruit, and vegetables", "C": "Low polyphenol intake or standard diet without emphasis on polyphenol-rich foods", "O": "Reduced risk of diabetes, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality"}, "publication_pmids": ["25832340", "21679483", "29501246", "29469027", "22218162", "5793323", "26530928", "18598589", "23612513", "23881072", "22186699", "4192147", "3927546", "21106916", "4613998", "3734096", "21481290", "22968335", "26269364", "23628082", "27655760", "24552647", "27225434", "29703769", "23332727", "21147716", "26081647", "29982448", "30459074", "25838546", "21058200", "27518801"], "pub_date": "2019/06/16"}

Our meta-analysis included 13 clinical trials with 2,402 patients participating. The overall response rate (ORR) was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38-76%), and the at least very good partial response rate (VGPR) was 32% (95% CI: 19-46%). mAb-based regimens prolonged progression-free survival (PFS, hazard ratio: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.36-0.75) compared to non-mAb-based regimens.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and quinine plus clindamycin during the first trimester. However, the national policies of many African countries currently recommend quinine throughout pregnancy. Therefore, the aim of this article is to provide a summary of the available data on the safety and efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in pregnancy. An English-language search identified 16 publications from 1989 to October 2011 with reports of artemether or AL exposure in pregnancy, including randomized clinical trials, observational studies and systematic reviews. Overall, there were 1,103 reports of AL use in pregnant women: 890 second/third trimester exposures; 212 first trimester exposures; and one case where the trimester of exposure was not reported. In the second and third trimesters, AL was not associated with increased adverse pregnancy outcomes as compared with quinine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, showed improved tolerability relative to quinine, and its efficacy was non-inferior to quinine. There is evidence to suggest that the pharmacokinetics of anti-malarial drugs may change in pregnancy, although the impact on efficacy and safety needs to be studied further, especially since the majority of studies report high cure rates and adequate tolerability. As there are fewer reports of AL safety in the first trimester, additional data are required to assess the potential to use AL in the first trimester. Though the available safety and efficacy data support the use of AL in the second and third trimesters, there is still a need for further information. These findings reinforce the WHO recommendation to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria with quinine plus clindamycin in early pregnancy and ACT in later pregnancy."}, "pico": {"P": "Pregnant women with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria", "I": "Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) treatment", "C": "Quinine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment", "O": "Safety and efficacy of AL compared to quinine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in pregnant women with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria"}, "publication_pmids": ["15512100", "17300626", "2605900", "2944339", "3071276", "3118160", "2245982", "11712093", "3098207", "20932805", "10681341", "10715685", "12362930", "15850630", "3346948", "19564366", "11463111", "10727880"], "pub_date": "2012/05/01"}

A computer literature search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central retrieved six randomized trials (462 patients) and one retrospective study (408 patients).

However, as with previous biofeedback approaches which rely on electroencephalography (EEG) or related approaches such as brain-machine interface technology (BCI), individual success rates vary significantly, and some participants never learn to control their brain responses at all. Given that these approaches are often being developed for eventual use in a clinical setting (albeit there is also significant interest in using NF for neuro-enhancement in typical populations), this represents a significant hurdle which requires more research. Here we present the findings of a systematic review which focused on how psychological variables contribute to learning outcomes in fMRI-based neurofeedback. However, as this is a relatively new methodology, we also considered findings from EEG-based neurofeedback and BCI. 271 papers were found and screened through PsycINFO, psycARTICLES, Psychological and Behavioural Sciences Collection, ISI Web of Science and Medline and 21 were found to contribute towards the aim of this survey. Several main categories emerged: Attentional variables appear to be of importance to both performance and learning, motivational factors and mood have been implicated as moderate predictors of success, while personality factors have mixed findings. We conclude that future research will need to systematically manipulate psychological variables such as motivation or mood, and to define clear thresholds for a successful neurofeedback effect. Non-responders need to be targeted for interventions and tested with different neurofeedback setups to understand whether their non-response is specific or general. Also, there is a need for qualitative evidence to understand how psychological variables influence participants throughout their training. This will help us to understand the subtleties of psychological effects over time. This research will allow interventions to be developed for non-responders and better selection procedures in future to improve the efficacy of neurofeedback."}, "pico": {"P": "Participants undergoing neurofeedback training", "I": "Manipulation of psychological variables such as motivation or mood during neurofeedback training", "C": "Standard neurofeedback training without manipulation of psychological variables", "O": "Improved learning outcomes and successful self-regulation of brain regions or networks in participants"}, "publication_pmids": ["3366978", "4692450", "16352728", "22021045", "20188627", "9121678"], "pub_date": "2019/01/15"}

The combination of neuropathic symptoms, signs, and electrodiagnostic findings provides the most accurate diagnosis of distal symmetric polyneuropathy.

The highest likelihood of polyneuropathy (useful for clinical trials) occurs with a combination of multiple symptoms, multiple signs, and abnormal electrodiagnostic studies.

However, study findings have been inconsistent. Inheritance of variant DNA repair genes is believed to influence individual susceptibility to the development of environmental cancer. Reliable knowledge on which the base excision repair (BER) sequence variants are associated with cancer risk would help elucidate the mechanism of cancer. Given that most of the previous studies had inadequate statistical power, we have conducted a systematic review on sequence variants in three important BER proteins. Here, we review published studies on the association between polymorphism in candidate BER genes and cancer risk. We focused on three key BER genes: 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1/APEX1) and x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1). These specific DNA repair genes were selected because of their critical role in maintaining genome integrity and, based on previous studies, suggesting that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes have protective or deleterious effects on cancer risk. A total of 136 articles in the December 13, 2010 MEDLINE database (National Center for Biotechnology Information, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) reporting polymorphism in OGG1, XRCC1 or APE1 genes were analyzed. Many of the reported SNPs had diverse association with specific human cancers. For example, there was a positive association between the OGG1 Ser326Cys variant and gastric and lung cancer, while the XRCC1 Arg399Gln variant was associated with reduced cancer risk. Gene-environment interactions have been noted and may be important for colorectal and lung cancer risk and possibly other human cancers."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with genetic variation in DNA repair genes", "I": "Polymorphisms in key DNA base excision repair proteins (OGG1, APE1, XRCC1)", "C": "Standard DNA repair genes without polymorphisms", "O": "Association between DNA repair gene polymorphisms and cancer risk"}, "publication_pmids": ["15333465", "18330515", "16308313"], "pub_date": "2012/10/01"}

Unfortunately, creatinine increase is a delayed and unreliable indicator of AKI. The lack of early biomarkers of structural kidney injury has hampered our ability to translate promising experimental therapies to human AKI. The recent discovery, translation and validation of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), possibly the most promising novel AKI biomarker, is reviewed here. NGAL may be measured by several methods both in plasma and urine for the early diagnosis of AKI and for the prediction of clinical outcomes, such as dialysis requirement and mortality, in several common clinical scenarios, including in the intensive care unit, cardiac surgery and renal damage due the exposition to toxic agent and drugs, and renal transplantation. Furthermore, the predictive properties of NGAL, may play a critical role in expediting the drug development process. A systematic review of literature data indicates that further studies are necessary to establish accurate reference population values according to age, gender and ethnicity, as well as reliable and specific decisional values concerning the more common clinical settings related to AKI. Furthermore, proper randomized clinical trials on renal and systemic outcomes comparing the use of NGAL vs. standard clinical practice are still lacking and accurate cost-benefit and/or cost-utility analyses for NGAL as biomarker of AKI are also needed. However, it is important to note that NGAL, in the absence of diagnostic increases in serum creatinine, is able to detect some patients affected by subclinical AKI who have an increased risk of adverse outcomes. These results also suggest that the concept and definition of AKI might need to be reassessed."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI)", "I": "Measurement of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in plasma and urine", "C": "Standard clinical practice (e.g. serum creatinine measurements)", "O": "Early diagnosis of AKI, prediction of clinical outcomes (dialysis requirement, mortality), detection of subclinical AKI, reassessment of the concept and definition of AKI"}, "publication_pmids": ["16931980", "18337554", "19114878", "3143832", "21511111", "21518160", "19680166", "18287807", "17874137", "2246223", "19938135", "19628673", "21836147", "19247188", "19762491", "21836143", "21956199", "16772710", "21458900", "18925531", "20798258", "18650797"], "pub_date": "2012/02/15"}

To systematically evaluate the evidence of whether massage therapy (MT) is effective for neck pain. Methods. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified through searches of 5 English and Chinese databases (to December 2012). The search terms included neck pain, neck disorders, cervical vertebrae, massage, manual therapy, Tuina, and random. In addition, we performed hand searches at the library of Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed the methodological quality of RCTs by PEDro scale. And the meta-analyses of improvements on pain and neck-related function were conducted. Results. Fifteen RCTs met inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that MT experienced better immediate effects on pain relief compared with inactive therapies (n = 153; standardised mean difference (SMD), 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.09 to 2.50; P = 0.03) and traditional Chinese medicine (n = 125; SMD, 0.73; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.33; P = 0.02). There was no valid evidence of MT on improving dysfunction. With regard to follow-up effects, there was not enough evidence of MT for neck pain. Conclusions. This systematic review found moderate evidence of MT on improving pain in patients with neck pain compared with inactive therapies and limited evidence compared with traditional Chinese medicine. There were no valid lines of evidence of MT on improving dysfunction.

Leukotreine receptor antagonists (LTRA) are also used for chronic urticaria, although firm recommendations on their use are lacking. We performed a systematic review of randomised trials to determine the role of LTRA in treatment of chronic urticaria. A search of PUBMED, EMBASE, SCOPUS, LILACS, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Web of Science for relevant randomized control trials or cross over studies yielded 10 eligible studies. The heterogeneity of trials were high, preventing valid meta-analysis of data. Most trials indicated that LTRA are not superior to placebo or antihistamine therapy, while combination therapy of LTRA and antihistamines appear to be more efficacious compared to antihistamine alone.

Effect of physical and psychosocial interventions on hormone and performance outcomes in professional rugby union players: a systematic review. J Strength Cond Res 31(11): 3158-3169, 2017-This systematic review investigates the acute effects of physical or psychosocial interventions on testosterone and cortisol responses in elite male rugby union players, and the subsequent association with physical performance areas (e.g., strength, power, sprint performance) or key performance indicators (e.g., coach-identified skills). Medline (via EBSCO), SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, InformIT, ProQuest, Cochrane, and Scopus were searched for relevant articles. Nine articles met the inclusion criteria, with 6 articles examining the effect of speed, strength or power training, and the remaining 3 psychosocial interventions. Quality assessment of the articles as determined by their PEDro score was either 6 or 7 out of 11. This review found that both physical and psychosocial interventions can alter testosterone and cortisol, and physical performance areas important for rugby union are affected by these changes. The limited literature in the field supports the notion that physical interventions of short duration and high intensity, and psychosocial interventions that create a positive environment may elicit a hormonal response that is associated with favorable performance outcomes. Studies that reported psychosocial interventions suggest that testosterone and cortisol may be altered in elite rugby players without metabolic stress, something of great interest to elite athletes and coaches who are looking to elicit a performance advantage without increasing athlete load. Overall, this review identified that when the testosterone responses to an intervention are notably greater than that of cortisol, favorable outcomes are likely.

Despite the differential response of some genetic polymorphisms, the Mediterranean diet has been shown to exert a protective action on this enzyme.

Other Mediterranean diet constituents, such as nuts, fruits and vegetables, have been effective in modulating the activity of the enzyme, pomegranate and its compounds being the best characterized items.

Literature search was done from PubMed, Google scholar, Ovid, and Medline databases. Studies which included post MI patients with moderate ischemic MR and reported mortality outcomes of performing CABG and MVR were chosen for the systematic review. Our preliminary literature search identified 194 studies, of which 11 studies met our inclusion criteria. Nine studies showed no survival benefit of performing simultaneous MVR and CABG. One study demonstrated survival benefit of performing CABG plus MVR only in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV, and one study suggested survival benefit of performing CABG plus MVR as compared to CABG alone in patient with ischemic MR irrespective of preoperative NYHA functional class. Review of current literature showed mixed results in terms of improvement in functional status but failed to show any survival benefit of performing MVR along with CABG. Limitations of studies include small sample size, difference in baseline demographic variables, and short follow-up period which might influence the outcome of the study.

Ketoprofen is a non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat acute and chronic painful conditions. Dexketoprofen is the (S)-enantiomer, which is believed to confer analgesia.

Correlating with recent literature, the objective of this review was to evaluate whether there was enough evidence for the authors to develop an institutional treatment protocol concerning the use of RT in the treatment of retroperitoneal sarcoma. Furthermore, this was a call for surgeons to talk to radiation oncologists before performing surgery. The 2 objectives of this review were: 1) to determine the benefit of RT in terms of local control and/or survival in the treatment of retroperitoneal sarcomas and 2) to discover the optimal timing of RT in the treatment sequence. A computerized literature search was performed in the PubMed database, the Cochrane Library database, and reference lists; and journals also were searched by hand to identify all retrospective and prospective reports published since 1998 relating to RT treatment of adult retroperitoneal sarcoma. Mainly, analyses were sought that were based on a 5-year local control rate (LCR), 5-year disease-free survival, and 5-year overall survival (OS). If only 2 years follow-up were available, then the authors also noted this outcome. Toxicity data were collected and analyzed separately. The synthesis of the literature was based on 9 prospectively nonrandomized studies and 10 retrospective studies that, together, reviewed a total of 1426 patients. The 5-year LCR varied from 27% to 62%, and the results from other reports fell in between those values. The 5-year OS rate ranged from 12% to 90%, and complete resection and tumor grade were the most important prognostic factors in most studies. This review resulted in 7 recommendations concerning the use of RT in the treatment of retroperitoneal sarcoma. The authors concluded that there is good evidence from multiple single-institutions studies that RT improves the LCR in patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma. Until now, there has not been a translation of this approach into survival benefit. The current results indicated that preoperative external-beam RT followed by radical surgery seems to be the preferred sequence, and adding intraoperative RT is a safe procedure for dose escalation in the upper abdomen."}, "pico": {"P": "Adult patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma", "I": "Radiotherapy (RT) in the treatment of retroperitoneal sarcoma", "C": "Standard care or surgery alone", "O": "5-year local control rate, 5-year disease-free survival, 5-year overall survival, toxicity data"}, "publication_pmids": ["16491338", "11584964", "15310783", "11986186", "16752414", "2395448", "11821462", "8457152", "9256126", "10758318", "16768769", "16411144", "11872294", "17094026", "19047280", "17916527"], "pub_date": "2011/10/01"}

An electronic search strategy was designed by a medical librarian and conducted in multiple databases. A total of 172 articles published between 1998 and 2008 were retrieved, analyzed, and synthesized. The first set of results (122 articles), which is presented in this paper, examined sex difference in the perception of laboratory-induced thermal, pressure, ischemic, muscle, electrical, chemical, and visceral pain in healthy subjects. This review suggests that females (F) and males (M) have comparable thresholds for cold and ischemic pain, while pressure pain thresholds are lower in F than M. There is strong evidence that F tolerate less thermal (heat, cold) and pressure pain than M but it is not the case for tolerance to ischemic pain, which is comparable in both sexes. The majority of the studies that measured pain intensity and unpleasantness showed no sex difference in many pain modalities. In summary, 10 years of laboratory research have not been successful in producing a clear and consistent pattern of sex differences in human pain sensitivity, even with the use of deep, tonic, long-lasting stimuli, which are known to better mimic clinical pain.

Systematic searches of medical bibliographic databases were conducted in February 2008 to identify suitable studies published from January 1988 onward. Articles were considered eligible for inclusion through the application of a predetermined protocol. Safety and effectiveness data from the comparison of two or more varicose vein procedures were extracted and analyzed. Seventeen studies, published between 2003 and 2007, were included in this review. Serious adverse events were rare. Minor adverse events were more common but generally self-limiting. All treatments displayed levels of effectiveness depending on the extent of the vein in question. Short-term advantages appeared to be associated with sclerotherapy and endovenous treatments, and long-term effectiveness was more apparent following surgical intervention. Evidence suggests conservative therapy is less effective than sclerotherapy and surgery for the treatment of varicose veins. Ligation with stripping plus phlebectomy is generally regarded as the \"gold standard\" for treating primary long saphenous veins. Sclerotherapy and surgery both appear to have a place in the management of varicose veins. Sclerotherapy and phlebectomy may also be more appropriate in patients with minor superficial varicose veins not related to reflux of the saphenous system or as a post- or adjunctive treatment to other procedures, such as surgery. Current evidence suggests endovenous laser therapy and radiofrequency ablation are as safe and effective as surgery, particularly in the treatment of saphenous veins.

In an attempt to provide clarity on the topic, we performed a systematic literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) electronic databases. Six studies were found to have met the inclusion criteria: (a) an experimental trial published in an English-language peer-reviewed journal; (b) the study compared the use of short (≤60 s) to long (>60 s) inter-set rest intervals in a traditional dynamic resistance exercise using both concentric and eccentric muscle actions, with the only difference in resistance training among groups being the inter-set rest interval duration; (c) at least one method of measuring changes in muscle mass was used in the study; (d) the study lasted for a minimum of four weeks, employed a training frequency of ≥2 resistance training days per week, and (e) used human participants without known chronic disease or injury. Current evidence indicates that both short and long inter-set rest intervals may be useful when training for achieving gains in muscle hypertrophy.

Although there has been an increasing interest in the quantitative assessment of breast density, no research has investigated the optimal technical approach of breast MRI in this aspect. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze the current studies on quantitative assessment of breast density using MRI and to determine the most appropriate technical/operational protocol. Databases (PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science) were searched systematically for eligible studies. Single arm meta-analysis was conducted to determine quantitative values of MRI in breast density assessments. Combined means with their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a fixed-effect model. In addition, subgroup meta-analyses were performed with stratification by breast density segmentation/measurement method. Furthermore, alternative groupings based on statistical similarities were identified via a cluster analysis employing study means and standard deviations in a Nearest Neighbor/Single Linkage. A total of 38 studies matched the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Twenty-one of these studies were judged to be eligible for meta-analysis. The results indicated, generally, high levels of heterogeneity between study means within groups and high levels of heterogeneity between study variances within groups. The studies in two main clusters identified by the cluster analysis were also subjected to meta-analyses. The review confirmed high levels of heterogeneity within the breast density studies, considered to be due mainly to the applications of MR breast-imaging protocols and the use of breast density segmentation/measurement methods. Further research should be performed to determine the most appropriate protocol and method for quantifying breast density using MRI."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients undergoing breast MRI for breast density assessment", "I": "Quantitative measurement of breast density using MRI", "C": "Different breast density segmentation/measurement methods", "O": "Identification of the most appropriate technical/operational protocol for quantifying breast density using MRI"}, "publication_pmids": ["27197299", "5697622", "4502611", "27091644", "4123610", "4468804", "27190766", "27197283", "25333307"], "pub_date": "2019/05/24"}

The fitted model suggested that for a shorter study duration, lower energy compensation was observed in younger individuals with higher initial fat mass (FM). In contrast, higher energy compensation was noted for younger individuals with lower initial FM. From 25 weeks onward, energy compensation was no longer different for these predictors.
